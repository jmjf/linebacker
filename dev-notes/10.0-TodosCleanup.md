# Do some TODO items and cleanup

Time to take a short break from adding and work on improving.

## REFACTOR: nanoid

Switch to nanoid instead of uuid for ids.

-  `npm install nanoid@3`; `npm uninstall uuid`
-  Change `UniqueIdentifier` to import an use instead of `uuid`
-  Replace uuid verify checks in test with length 21 checks (nanoid has no verify method)

And change script `test:dev` to `test:watch` because I always forget.

Cleanup from earlier work with TypeORM (because I see a couple of tests failing due to the Prisma/TypeORM split)

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: use nanoid instead of uuid; fix broken tests from TypeORM add**

## FIX: If CreateBackupRequest gets no backupJobId, it generates one

Because it calls `new UniqueIdentifier(dto.backupJobId)`, which will always return an id.

Stemmler makes them `Entity` types. I'm not sure that would handle my case and I don't want to do it. Options:

-  Let the use case check and return (Should it know the backup id is required?)
   -  Some use cases are retrieving data from the repo and ensuring they get a result, but that's more an orchestration concern.
   -  Some use cases check that a status is as expected, but that's a business process concern (this step of the process requires this status); the data is valid, but may not be valid for the use case
-  Passing a string to `BackupRequest.create()` (it will check)
   -  This feels more correct because `BackupRequest` is responsible for knowing it needs a value for `backupJobId`

To do

-  Add a test for this case in the use case tests (typeorm and prisma)
   -  Improve existing test to `test.each()` for all required values
-  Write code to make it pass
   -  Makes `BackupJobId: string | UniqueIdentifier` on `BackupRequest`
   -  After null/undefined guard, if it's a string, convert `UniqueIdentifier`
   -  In repos, `mapToDomain` can pass string now
   -  In controllers, needed to cast to `UniqueIdentifier` to reference value

**COMMIT: FIX: ensure CreateBackupRequestUseCase errors if backupJobId is null/undefined**

## REFACTOR: Add Prisma prefix on Prisma entities

Avoid confusion with my entities/aggregates with the same name.

-  Rename entities in schema; use `@@map("tablename")` to get desired table name
-  `npx prisma generate` to update the client
-  This change affects mocks in all the Prisma tests, so fix them (including controller tests, event tests)
-  Also affects repos (prisma.backup* -> prisma.prismaBackup*), so fix them

Also, make mapping functions explicit to avoid possible issues with data types.

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: add Prisma prefix to Prisma entities**

## FIX: ReceiveStoreStatusReplyUseCase

### What needs to be done?

-  Revisit the logic
   -  If the backup exists, do not save it again
   -  If the backup request is already succeeded or failed, do not save again
-  Adjust tests

What happens and what to change

-  RSSRUC gets a reply DTO
-  Guard result type code is valid value (Succeeded or Failed); err if not valid value
-  Guard request id is not null or undefined; err if null or undefined
   -  Should guard other required values? No, let Backup do its job.
   -  Guard request id because it's coming from outside linebacker.
-  Get request; err if any err (database, not found, etc.)
   -  Must have a request it can use
-  **STATE: we have a valid status for a request we know about**
-  **PROPOSED CHANGE:** return ok if request is Succeeded or Failed
   -  Is this direction correct?
   -  **Critical decision for duplicate handling here**
-  Get backup job based on id in request; err if any err (http, not found, etc)
   -  Must have a backup job because data needed for Backup may have changed since request was sent
-  **STATE: add valid backup job**
-  Get Backup for request id; err if err other than not found
   -  Not found means it doesn't exist, which is the happy path
   -  Found (ok) means it exists, which is the half-happy path (something failed, but we can recover)
-  **STATE: add existing Backup or no Backup**
-  If Backup found, use it (no change, no save) -- handles "existing Backup"
   -  Duplicate handling -> the first status we get and write is assumed to be correct, so never rewrite if it exists
-  If Backup not found AND reply is succeeded -- handles "no Backup"
   -  Create it; err if err (PropsError most likely)
   -  Save it; err if err (DatabaseError most likely)
   -  **NOTE: Only create/save Backup for succeed replies; do not create/save for failed replies**
-  **STATE: valid status, valid request, Backup exists (on database)**
   -  Either the Backup existed before (existing branch) or the use case created it, saved it, and got no error (no Backup branch)
-  If backup id has a value set request succeeded else set request failed
   -  As this point, if we have a backup id, we either saved a Backup successfully or found a Backup (saved it before but had an error updating the request)
   -  So, if a backup id exists, the request succeeded, else it failed, no need to look at reply status here to determine request status (ensures duplicates don't change request status to be mismatched with Backup state)
-  Save the request; err if err
-  Return ok request

So, the key decision is about the proposed change. For duplicate replies:

-  Option 1: always ignore the second reply (request status must be Sent)
   -  Advantage: strictly follows the state model
   -  Assumption: the process strictly follows the state model--never inconsistent
   -  Request Sent and reply failed followed by Succeeded -> Request Failed and no Backup exists
-  Option 2: if the second reply succeeds, accept it (request status must be Sent or Failed)
   -  Advantage: ensures a succeeded reply after a failed reply will write a Backup so we have a record
   -  Assumption: a succeeded reply means a real backup exists and should be recorded **only if Sent or Failed**
   -  Request Sent and reply Failed followed by Succeeded -> Request Succeeded and Backup exists
-  Option 3: Option 2 but any request status other than succeeded (request status must not be Succeeded)
   -  Advantage: ensures any succeeded reply results in a Backup (first succeeded only due to provisions of Option 2)
   -  Assumption: a succeded reply means a real backup exists and should be recorded **in all cases**
   -  Reply Succeeded -> Request Succeeed and Backup exists (no change on any later reply)

If the goal is to ensure that any real backup that may be stored is recorded in the Backup table, then Option 3 is the choice to make.

-  Risk: Linebacker creates a Backup when no real backup exist OR something deletes the real backup without telling Linebacker; the latter is a real world problem
-  Solution: When deleting backups, the backup interface can reply with a "does not exist" status so Linebacker can status/delete the Backup (option TBD)

So, let's go with Option 3. That choice means no check on the request status and no change to the existing logic.

-  Request Sent + Reply Failed -> No Backup written (reply status must be Succeeded to create/save Backup); Request Failed (set/save status based on backupId)
-  Request Sent + Reply Succeeded -> Write backup; Request Succeeded
-  Request Failed + Reply Failed -> No Backup written; Request Failed (updated in this case)
   -  Is the Request update a problem; if so, how to know when to update when to not update (maybe no update if request status matches reply status)
-  Request Failed + Reply Succeeded -> Write Backup (request Failed -> no Backup written); Request Succeeded
-  Request Succeeded + Reply Failed -> Backup exists from earlier succeed, no change; Request Succeeded (updated in this case)
   -  Is the Request update a problem; same question as above
-  Request Succceded + Reply Succceded -> Backup exists from earlier succeed, no change; Request Succeeded (updated in this case)
   -  Is the Request update a problem; same question as above
-  **KEY ASSUMPTION:** Request status will never be set to Succeeded without writing a Backup
   -  The use case ensures this assumption is valid
   -  BUT if humans muck with the data in the backend, they can break it (can't idiot-proof a system)

Add a check before updating and saving the request.

-  If request status and reply status are both succeeded or are both failed, return ok
-  Compare like request status === succeeded && reply status === succeeded in case the values are different
   -  Use the named references, not the real values, to avoid value coupling and to make the comparison explicit

### How to test

-  Prepare for Backup handling
   -  [x] Reply status not Failed or Succeeded -> err
   -  [x] Request id null or undefined -> err
   -  [x] Request get resolves null -> err (NotFoundError)
   -  [x] Request get rejects -> err (DatabaseError)
   -  [x] Backup Job get err -> err
   -  [x] Backup for request id get err other than Not Found -> err (DatabaseError)
-  'Backup create and save error handling (Backup not found, reply Succeeded)
   -  [x] Missing required property -> err (PropsError); `test.each()` required prop (4 tests)
   -  [x] Save err -> err (DatabaseError)
-  Backup Request save error handling
   Backup Request save and duplicate reply/partial update handling
   -  [] Backup saved and Request save err -> err (DatabaseError)
   -  [] Backup found and Request save err -> err (DatabaseError)
      -  Proves found is handled correctly (skips Backup save)
      -  Avoids duplicating remaining tests for Backup found
   -  Backup not found (Failed cases, won't save Backup):
      -  [] Reply Failed + Request Sent -> ok; Backup save not called; Request save called; Request status Failed
      -  [] Reply Failed + Request Failed -> ok; Backup save not called; Request save not called; Request status Failed
   -  Backup not found (Succeeded cases, save Backup and Request)
   -  [] Reply Succeeded + Request Sent -> ok; Backup save called; Request save called; Request status Succeeded
   -  [] Reply Succeeded + Request Failed -> ok; Backup save called; Request save called; Request status Succeeded
   -  Backup found (Succeeded cases)
   -  [] Reply Failed + Request Succeeded -> ok; (Backup exists) Backup save not called; Request save not called; Request status Succeeded
   -  [] Reply Succeded + Request Succeeded -> ok; (Backup exists) Backup save not called; Request save not called; Request status Succeeded

Organize existing tests based on plan above. Write new tests or change existing tests as needed.

### Write the code

Plan

-  Start with Typeorm repo
-  Set jest watch to run only this use case's tests (file name filter)
-  Comment out code in the use case and return ok in all cases (pretend no code is there)
-  Copy existing tests to a side file
-  Delete tests from the test file (keep all setup)
-  Loop
   -  If test exists, copy test from the side file matching plan order above; change as needed to meet requirements
   -  If test does not exist, write it
   -  Watch test fail
   -  Uncomment corresponding code
   -  Watch test pass

This ended up being more build in blocks because some blocks were related. Passing one might have passed others, so needed to get them all out there before writing the code. Otherwise, the plan worked.

**COMMIT: FIX: (Typeorm version) review logic for ReceiveStoreStatusReplyUseCase; rewrite tests based on review; revise use case to pass**

Now Typeorm version of tests is done, copy and do Prisma version. It will be some work, but should be straightforward.

I added an alternate approach to handling `BackupRequest` as a comment in `ReceiveStoreStatusReplyUseCase`. It sets request status based on the store status reply from the interface and does not override request status based on presence of a Backup. It may result in cases where the request status is inconsistent with Backup, but it does capture the status returned by the interface, ensuring that any message is consistent with the status.

If using the alternate approach, tests will change.

Prisma notes

-  Made PrismaBackup.deletedTimestamp nullable (because it should be); regenerated client
-  Main thing to note is that the Prisma repo uses different methods:
   -  `findOne` -> `findUnique` for `BackupRequest` (repo `getById`)
   -  `findOne` -> `findFirst` for `Backup` (repo `getByBackupRequestId`)
   -  `save` -> `upsert` for `Backup` (repo `save`)

**COMMIT: FIX: (Prisma version) rewrite tests based on Typeorm tests**

## CHORE: Confirm TypeORM can handle MAX_SAFE_INTEGER in integer type

It can't. So, change `TypeormBackup` to use `bigint` and `string`. Change the Backup repo to convert string to/from number.

**COMMIT: FIX: change Backup entity and repo to deal with TypeORM's bigint -> string mapping**

## REFACTOR: Replace morgan with pino in Express

Because why have two loggers?

## FIX: Remove explicit any in code

I get eslint warnings about explicit `any`. The way to avoid them is `unknown` and cast the value where it's used, which forces me to specify a type so TypeScript can check it instead of telling TypeScript to not check.

I use explict `any` rarely and always in the external facing adapter code, so this warning probably isn't a major threat to code stability. But it should be a simple enough fix and fewer warnings is better in most cases.

## CHORE: Ensure log outputs are consistent

-  In some places I use message, in others msg
-  Some places not an object string maybe
-  requestId -> backupRequestId to avoid future confusion
-  Consider adding some kind of context for the log to make the code findable
