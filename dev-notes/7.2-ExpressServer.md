# Get an Express server running

## Plan

-  Build a server for Express and accept HTTP calls
-  See log output that shows linebacker is handling them correctly
-  This means figuring out logging for Express (built into Fastify already)

## Action

Follow the pattern I used for Fastify

-  Create `expressServer.ts`
   -  Use `fastifyServer` as a model
   -  Add `winston` and `morgan` for logging (for now, may use `pino` later)
      -  `npm install winston morgan`
      -  https://lioncoding.com/loggin-in-express-js-using-winston-and-morgan
      -  https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/09/01/best-practices-for-logging-in-nodejs.html
      -  Create `src/common/infrastructure/logger.ts` to use `winston`
      -  Create `src/morganMiddleware.ts` and use it in `expressApp.ts`
   -  Use `logger` to output log messages
-  Tests are passing
-  Write `express:dev` script and run it
-  POST works, but events aren't running
   -  In `expressRoutes`, call `initBackupRequestModule`
-  POST works and I see the row in Sent status
-  Add delays to adapters; see status change

It's working.
