## TODO list

-  Redis
   -  Connect errors are throwing and not being caught properly in BullMQ (configure incorrect port)
      -  Probably because `eventBus` doesn't wrap `new` in a `try...catch`
   -  Figure out Redis configuration so I can secure Redis (simulate real world production)
-  Production and `pm2` readiness
   -  When application `AbortController` fires, delay long enough for things to shut down
   -  Also need `pm2` graceful shutdown/start behavior
   -  Replace `FakeAuthNZ` with carefully guarded test handling in auth middlewares so we don't need `test-helpers` in `dist`
-  Go through [I, Azure, Mock]BISA adapters and ensure return types make sense; clean up as needed
-  Think through how you really want to implement queue adapters (like it is; generic code; specific adapter wraps parent as needed; etc.)
-  Move the zpages API to a different service within the application service set; assign it a separate port
-  Consider pausing BullMq workers when a dependency is down
   -  Worker needs to know which services it cares about and how to check availability
   -  Needs a simple way to keep track of service availability and update when it fails
-  Consider putting more controls around `appState` changes (methods, etc.)
