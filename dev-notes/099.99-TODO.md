## TODO list

-  Create a configuration object singleton that builds itself from `process.env`
   -  Move all `process.env` values that matter, `dotenv`, etc., into the singleton
   -  Structure it sanely; use everywhere
   -  Revamp `.env` files as needed
   -  For BullMq/Redis
      -  Queue settings are hard coded in `publish`; retry count should be large
      -  Custom backoff policy that increments to a max and then stays at that max
      -  Connection details
-  In `AzureQueue.receiveMessages()`, make the visibility timeout configurable
   -  From environment or from caller as a parameter (TBD)
-  Figure out Redis configuration so I can secure Redis (simulate real world production)
-  When application `AbortController` fires, delay long enough for things to shut down
   -  Also need to trigger abort on SIGINT or similar
-  Go through [I, Azure, Mock]BISA adapters and ensure return types make sense; clean up as needed
-  Think through how you really want to implement queue adapters (like it is; generic code; specific adapter wraps parent as needed; etc.)
-  Find a way to import `FakeAuthNZ` in local dev only
-  Move the zpages API to a different service within the application service set; assign it a separate port
-  Consider pausing BullMq workers when a dependency is down
   -  Worker needs to know which services it cares about and how to check availability
   -  Needs a simple way to keep track of service availability and update when it fails
