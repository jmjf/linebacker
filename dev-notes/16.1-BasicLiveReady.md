# Build initial liveness, readiness, and health endpoints

## From 16.0

Use the path prefix `.../api/zpages` with `livez`, `readyz`, and `healthz`. The `healthz` endpoint may require a special scope, but for now I'll leave it open to any caller.

Build a basic version that supports `livez`, `readyz`, and `healthz`. For `healthz` only report start time, up time, and resource use.

## Planning

Put it in a `zpages` module. This feature is all about supporting container restart, load balancers (readiness), and letting other applications know if they should make a call (related to their implementations of circuit breakers and retries). I'll call the module `AppHealth`.

-  `livez` and `readyz` return 200
-  Add server shutdown status; `livez` and `readyz` return 500 if shutting down
-  Add start time and `healthz`

## Basic live/ready

Tests

-  `livez` returns 200
-  `readyz` returns 200
-  Simulating failure means testing that http calls timeout, which is deep infrastructure outside of application scope, so no failure tests

**COMMIT: FEAT: add basic livez and readyz routes**

## Add healthz

Start time doesn't need to be millisecond-precise, so capture it in the build function.

Route just assembles the body and returns it.
