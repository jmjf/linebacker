# Improve pm2 and general production readiness

-  Production and `pm2` readiness
   -  Replace `FakeAuthNZ` with test-only variant in auth middlewares so we don't need `test-helpers` in `dist`
   -  `pm2` graceful shutdown/start behavior
      -  [Reference](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/signals-clean-restart/)
   -  When application `AbortController` fires, delay long enough for things to shut down
      -  [`AbortSignal.onabort`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#event-abort)

## Removing FakeAuthNZ

-  Add `isTest()` checks in auth middlewares
-  Change `isTest()` and `isDev()` code to be more precise
   -  Instead of not prod, looks for dev
-  Change `apiApp` to not use `FakeAuthNZ` and run test; failures in `ExpressAcceptBackupRequestController`
   -  Getting 403 where other responses expected
   -  Issue was, in middlewares, need to `return next()` not just `next()` the way they're written
-  Change `rcvApp` to not use `FakeAuthNZ`
-  All unit tests are passing

## pm2-friendly shutdown and start

What needs to happen on shutdown?

-  Stop accepting http requests
   -  Need to get the server instance the Express `listen()` call returns so I can `server.close()`
-  Wait a few seconds so in-flight requests have a chance to process
   -  `delay(5000)`
-  If bullmq, close Redis connection (???)
-  Close database connection
   -  `typeormDataSource.destroy()`
-  Exit
   -  Because this is a commanded, controlled exit, `process.exit(0)`
   -  `pm2` knows it it requested shutdown for restart, so should be okay (test)

For BullMQ, `publish` creates a new `Queue` instance with a connection every time it's called. Added `close()` call to ensure nothing is hanging.

-  I wanted to persist the connection so I could close it on shutdown only, but I'm not sure I can do that safely (possible contention???)
-  Probably can, which might reduce connect/disconnect overhead, but for now, go with this
-  I want to performance test to measure overhead to get a sense of how much persisting the connection saves
-  I may want to create a common Redis connection in `rcvSrvExpTypeorm`

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: remove dependency on FakeAuthNZ; ensure BullMQ bus closes connections**

## Add shutdown features

Based on the list above, write a shutdown method and call it when the application gets a shutdown signal.

-  Add `shutdown()` in `src/shutdown.ts`
-  Add event listeners per `pm2` docs to call `shutdown()` in `apiSrvExpTypeorm.ts` and `rcvSrvExpTypeorm.ts`
-  TypeScript doesn't like calling `process.send('ready')` as `pm2` docs suggest because `send` only exists if the process is opened in an IPC channel
   -  Rely on `listen` to tell `pm2` the app is ready?
   -  I could probably call `send` only if it exists and have a reliable ready message, not sure if telling `pm2` to listen for ready also listens for listen

Set up a test. Tell `pm2` to wait for ready on the api, but don't send it. See if `pm2` restarts.

-  Fixed a couple of small breaks caused by removing exports from `eventBus` (put them back)
-  Looks like `pm2` sees the api as up even though it didn't send a ready, which means is must be recognizing listen too
-  I don't think sending a ready will do anything, but I'll include it, just in case

Added `abortController.abort()` to `shutdown` and passed `appAbortController` to it. (Forgot in the list in the previous section.)

**COMMIT: FEAT: add pm2 graceful shutdown/start**
