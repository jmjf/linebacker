# Improve pm2 and general production readiness

-  Production and `pm2` readiness
   -  Replace `FakeAuthNZ` with test-only variant in auth middlewares so we don't need `test-helpers` in `dist`
   -  `pm2` graceful shutdown/start behavior
      -  [Reference](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/signals-clean-restart/)
   -  When application `AbortController` fires, delay long enough for things to shut down
      -  [`AbortSignal.onabort`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#event-abort)

## Removing FakeAuthNZ

-  Add `isTest()` checks in auth middlewares
-  Change `isTest()` and `isDev()` code to be more precise
   -  Instead of not prod, looks for dev
-  Change `apiApp` to not use `FakeAuthNZ` and run test; failures in `ExpressAcceptBackupRequestController`
   -  Getting 403 where other responses expected
   -  Issue was, in middlewares, need to `return next()` not just `next()` the way they're written
-  Change `rcvApp` to not use `FakeAuthNZ`
-  All unit tests are passing

## pm2-friendly shutdown and start

What needs to happen on shutdown?

-  Stop accepting http requests
   -  Need to get the server instance the Express `listen()` call returns so I can `server.close()`
-  Wait a few seconds so in-flight requests have a chance to process
   -  `delay(5000)`
-  If bullmq, close Redis connection (???)
-  Close database connection
   -  `typeormDataSource.destroy()`
-  Exit
   -  Because this is a commanded, controlled exit, `process.exit(0)`
   -  `pm2` knows it it requested shutdown for restart, so should be okay (test)

For BullMQ, `publish` creates a new `Queue` instance with a connection every time it's called. Added `close()` call to ensure nothing is hanging.

-  I wanted to persist the connection so I could close it on shutdown only, but I'm not sure I can do that safely (possible contention???)
-  Probably can, which might reduce connect/disconnect overhead, but for now, go with this
-  I want to performance test to measure overhead to get a sense of how much persisting the connection saves

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: remove dependency on FakeAuthNZ; ensure BullMQ bus closes connections**
