# Run a server

## Plan

7.1 - Fastify server

-  Build a server for Fastify and accept HTTP calls
-  Use Postgres in a container for Prisma
   -  Need a Docker setup for this; use `docker-compose` and include adminer
-  See log output that shows linebacker is handling them correctly

7.2 - Express server

-  Build a server for Express and accept HTTP calls
-  See log output that shows linebacker is handling them correctly
-  This means figuring out logging for Express (built into Fastify already)

7.3 - Add authentication

-  I want to use OAuth client credentials grant
-  auth0 has a free account that meets my needs; many how-tos for Fastify and Express
-  I want to avoid any IdP-specific SDKs to keep the authentication portable
-  But I'd be okay with middlewares like Passport or similar that work with any IdP

7.4 - Logging

-  Figure out how to hook into logging so all logs go to the same place
-  Do I want to do all logging in controllers/adapters?
-  Or do I want a logging adapter so use cases can provide details that may get lost otherwise
   -  What kind of logging would I do from a use case that wouldn't bubble up to the controller or happen in an adapter?
   -  I'd like events to log that they're running, how to I get them a logger? (Declare outside the server and import?)
