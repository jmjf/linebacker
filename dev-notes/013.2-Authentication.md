# Authentication

I have some unique authentication requirements for reasons.

-  Clients must provide OAuth id tokens (no authorization claims) as bearer tokens in the Authorization header
-  Token public keys are not available through JWKS or a "wellknown" endpoint (uses a custom endpoint)
   -  But, for demo purposes, I'll use a public auth provider that does support JWKS, so will use `get-jwks` to manage public keys
-  Keys may be issued by different issuers with different urls

AuthN middleware should take

-  Options for `fast-jwt`, which I'll use to verify and decode tokens
-  A function to retrieve token public keys
   -  This could be something like `get-jwks.getPublicKey` or a custom function
   -  The function should be async and return a Promise
   -  The function will cache keys with a ttl
      -  Stale keys stay in the cache on non-404 error from key provider
      -  Consider using mnemonist's LRU and handling ttl in caching functions
      -  Or consider @isaacs/ttlcache and don't worry about LRU
   -  Function accepts a token that includes `kid` and `alg` members
   -  Pattern on `get-jwks.getPublicKey`
   -  On config, can I include key endpoint(s) or suffix to add to `iss`?
   -  Options
      -  maxCache, ttl, allowedDomains (or domain to endpoint map)

Question: Does the token `fast-jwt` passes to the function include `iss`? (Check this.)

-  No. Testing shows it only includes `alg`, `typ`, and `kid`.
-  This makes a sort of sense if you don't trust the `iss` to give you a reliable issuer until it's verified
   -  Someone could forge `iss` and point you to their own JWKS or similar
   -  But isn't that why we have `allowedDomains`?
-  In the example for `@fastify/jwt` it does have `iss` available to pass as the domain
   -  `@fastify/jwt` decodes the token and passes the full decoded token to the verifier
   -  It creates the verifier on the fly
-  So
   -  Get the token from the Authorization header
   -  Decode the token and get the `iss`
   -  Create the verifier using the `iss` as the domain
      -  Ensure `opts.allowedDomains` includes `iss`

```typescript
export interface AuthnerizerOptions {
	allowedIssuers: string[];
	fastjwtVerifierOptions: VerifierOptions;
	getPublicKey: (token: string) => Promise<string>;
	logError: (obj: object, msg?: string) => void;
	reqTraceIdKey?: string;
}
const opts: AuthnerizerOptions = {
	allowedIssuers: string[];
	// Required
	// allowed values for the iss member of the token body
	// Tokens with iss not in this list will be rejected. Must not be an empty array.
	// Authnerizer checks before creating the fast-jwt verifier.

	fastjwtVerifierOptions?: VerifierOptions;
	// Optional
	// options to pass to fast-jwt's createVerifier
	// Authnerizer requires and overrides the following values { key: getPublicKey, complete: true }
	// All other values will be passed through

	getPublicKey // TBD if really needed

	logError: (obj: object, msg?: string | undefined) => void;
	// Required
	// the function to use when logging authentication errors
	// Choose the log level by choosing the appropriate function from your logger
	// or wrap a logger that doesn't conform in a function to adapt it.

	reqTraceIdKey?: string;
	// Optional
	//	the name of the key from which to get the request's trace id
	// If not defined, the trace id will not be logged.

};

const jsonBodyErrorHandler = buildJsonBodyErrorHandler( opts );
```

While writing the call docs above, I spotted a few problems.

-  If I create the verifier for each call, I lose `fast-jwt`'s caching benefits
-  The `getPublicKey` parmeter needs to be a factory that returns a `getPublicKey` function for a given `iss`
-  Then I can build a `Map` that lets me look up the right verifier for a given `iss` in the middleware
-  BUT, before I add that complexity, I need to check on some details
   -  My IdP has < 10 issuers
   -  It may use the same keys for all `iss`; if so I could use one source for public keys
   -  In which case I can create the verifier in the build and use the same `getPublicKey` for all
   -  Or maybe remove `getPublicKey` and code it in the middleware

For now, I think the middleware is reasonably solid except for that consideration.

**COMMIT: FEAT: add authn middleware; not tested yet**

## Let's try to run it

For now, with `tracerizer` and `pinomor` only.

Problems found and fixed

-  In `pinomor`
   -  `BigInt` is a function, not a constructor (like Symbol); removed `new`
-  In `expressAppTypeorm`
   -  Reordered middleware because I wasn't getting a body; not sure if it made a difference, but whatever
   -  When passing logger methods, `.bind(logger)`
-  In `src/backup-request/expressRoutesTypeorm`
   -  cast `request` passed to the controller as `LinebackerRequest`
-  In `src/common/adapters/ExpressController`
   -  Make `LinebackerRequest` an alias for `CustomRequest`
-  In `src/backup-request/adapters/impl/ExpressCreateBackupRequestControllers`
   -  Fix trace id member name `tracerizerTraceId`

**COMMIT: TEST: get it running**

**COMMIT: TEST: fix unit tests broken by changes**

## Thoughts about how AuthN/AuthZ middleware will affect testing

I'm going to face a challenge in controller unit tests with authentication. I'd like to keep the authN and authZ middleware out of controller tests because mocking them will be a pain.

What if

-  Build fake AuthN/AuthZ middleware that
   -  Gets Authorization header (authHeader)
   -  Splits contents (`[ sub, ...scopes] = authHeader.split('|')`)
   -  Adds `req.jwtPayload.sub` set to `sub`
   -  Adds `req.clientScopes` set to `scopes`
-  In `buildApp`, if `isTest()`, use fake middleware

This approach lets the test specify whatever values it wants and doesn't require a lot of tester effort, opaque tokens, etc. And the middleware is simple.

```javascript
// middleware

function fakeAuthNZ(req, req, next) {
	const authHeader = req.get('TestAuth');
	const [sub, ...scopes] = authHeader.split('|');
	req.jwtPayload = { sub };
	req.clientScopes = scopes;
	next();
}

// test setup using supertest's request
request(app).post(testUrl).set('TestAuth', 'jwtPayload.sub|clientScope1|clientScope2');
```

This has the advantage of failing if it gets a JWT, so will be detected very quickly if, for some crazy reason, `isTest()` returns true in a non-test environment (because legitimate calls will fail). I also beefed up `isTest()` to check that the first four characters of `NODE_ENV` or `APP_ENV` are not `prod`.

**COMMIT: FEAT: improve isTest() by checking NODE_ENV and APP_ENV to reduce risk of true in production**

## Other changes

-  Replace `getPublicKey` option with `buildGetPublicKey` that accepts a domain and returns a `getPublicKey` method
   -  In this demo, it's wrapping `get-jwks.getPublicKey`
-  Make AuthNerizer build verifiers per allowed issuer up front so it can use caching
   -  Uses `buildGetPublicKey` to generate a `getPublicKey` method for each issuer because `getPublicKey` requires issuer domain, which isn't passed from `fast-jwt`
-  Add fake auth and get Express controller tests working with it (TypeORM and Prisma)
   -  Tested by logging auth values from request in the controller to confirm it was getting data into the request
