# Add connection down handling with optional retries

## What is the goal?

When external services fail, I don't want the application waiting on timeouts. I want to know the service is down and not try operations that will fail.

I also need to set up certain use cases to retry so I don't orphan request processing.

-  When a call to an external service (database, backup job service, Azure, etc.) fails, increment a counter
-  When enough calls fail, fast fail calls to the service
   -  "Enough" TBD
-  For some use cases (event triggered), I want to setup retries if the action fails due to an adapter error
   -  Store an event that will retry the use case
   -  When the connection is restored, publish the events
   -  Needs to be set up in the event handler
-  Periodically call to see if the resource is alive; when calls succeed allow calls through
-  When enough calls succeed, trigger any pending retries

For the database, I don't want retries, just fail-fast and try a health query periodically until it's available.

For the backup job service and backup interface (Azure queue), I want retries.

I'm calling this a circuit breaker (CB), but it isn't a traditional circuit breaker.

## Thinking through it

Subscribers execute use cases which use adapters.

Adapters call services outside the application.

-  A "connect failure" means the service call failed due to network problems or a problem on the external service (example: HTTP 500-series errors)
-  All other failures are not connect failures
-  In most cases, a failure that is not a connect failure will always fail, so would not be retried
   -  In cases where this is not true, the adapter treats the failure as a connect failure to make it true
-  The adapter provides an `isAlive` method that is a low-cost health check
   -  SQL database -> `select 1 where 1 = 1;`
   -  HTTP service -> a low cost API call (ideally, a specific health check call)
   -  Calls the circuit breaker's `onSuccess()` if ok, `onFailure` if failure, returns `true` if ok, error if failure

The circuit breaker has:

-  `state : 'closed' | 'halfopen' | 'open'`; set closed in the constructor
   -  closed means the connection is good; open means the connection is down
-  `successCount`, `failureCount`; set both 0 in the constructor
-  `halfOpenRetryDelayMs`, `closedRetryDelayMs`, `closedAliveCheckDelayMs`, delay times in milliseconds; set in the constructor
-  `isAlive`, a reference to the adapter's `isAlive()`; set in the constructor
-  getter for `state`
-  `onSuccess()`
   -  if `state` is not closed (not all good)
      -  increment `successCount`
      -  if `successCount >= successThreshold` set `state` to closed and `failureCount` to 0 else set `state` halfopen
-  `onFailure()`
   -  if `state` is closed
      -  increment `failureCount`
   -  if `failureCount >= failureThreshold` set `state` to open, `successCount` to 0, and start `awaitIsAlive()`
   -  Note: `onSuccess()` does not reset `failureCount` until closed, so halfOpen will go open on any failure
-  `retryEvents: IDomainEvent[]`
-  `runRetries()`
   -  `for ev of retryEvents`
      -  if `state` is not open
         -  `DomainEventBus.publishEvent(ev)`
         -  Remove event from `retryEvents`
         -  if `state` is closed and `closedRetryDelayMs > 0` `await delay(closedRetryDelayMs)` else `await delay(halfOpenRetryDelayMs)`
         -  Allows `state` to change to open due to an event running and failing; ensures no more retries run
         -  Should be similar to `DomainEventBus` publish all events; can I tie into that somehow
-  `awaitIsAlive()`
   -  while state is `open`
      -  if `!isAlive()` `await delay(closedAliveCheckDelay)`
   -  `runRetries()`

Create a circuit breaker for each service and pass to the adapters that need it. For example, many repos might use the same database or might have several queue listeners listening to the same queue service. This lets any adapter success or failure influence the service state for all adapters (more consistent)

An adapter has a circuit breaker, which is passed in its constructor (optional). For each call the adapter makes:

-  If the circuit breaker is open, return an error with connect failure type `errorData`
   -  Do not do this for `isAlive()`
-  If the call succeeds, call the circuit breaker's `onSuccess()`
-  If the call fails due to a connect failure
   -  Call the circuit breaker's `onFailure()`
   -  In the error's `errorData`, include
      -  `isConnectFailure: true`
      -  `isAlive`, a reference to the adapter's `isAlive()`
      -  `addRetryEvent`, a reference to the adapter's circuit breaker's `addRetryEvent()`
      -  `serviceName`: the name of the service to which the adapter connects (identifies circuit breaker)
      -  Can set these items up as an object on the adapter and spread into `errorData` when needed
-  Adapters must have some way of knowing which failures are connect failures
   -  Examples:
      -  Array of error names and `connectFailures.includes(error.name)`
      -  A method that returns true or false
   -  The adapter knows the specifics of the service and framework code so is the logical place to classify errors

The use case returns any adapter error to its caller, so the caller gets the `errorData`--do not rewrap adapter errors.

In the subscriber

-  `serviceAliveChecks`, a dictionary object of `isAlive()` functions keyed by `serviceName`
-  Before running the use case
   -  For each entry in `serviceAliveChecks`, call the function
   -  If any call fails, fail fast; by calling `isAlive()`; each event may change the circuit breaker state
-  If `errorData.isConnectFailure`
   -  If `serviceIsAliveChecks` does not have a key for `errorData.serviceName`, add the key and set value to `errorData.isAlive`
   -  Set up retry event and call `errorData.addRetryEvent` with it

How does this work if I want to set up a retry from anything other than a subscriber?

-  I'm not sure this question makes sense
   -  A controller needs a definite response; client is responsible for any retries
   -  An adapter doesn't know who is calling it, so doesn't know what, if any, event it needs to set up
   -  A queue poller relies on the queue to bring the message back later, so retries happen automatically
      -  A queue message handler doesn't delete the message from the queue until the use case is ok, so same story
-  BUT, anything that wants to set up a retry can call `errorData.addRetryEvent` and add the event
   -  It won't set up `serviceIsAliveChecks`, will rely on the adapter's fast fail
   -  It will need a subscriber to the event to get the retry

## How to test the circuit breaker?

That's a good question!

Testing requires a circuit breaker, subscriber, use case, adapter, and the ability to simulate connection failures in a way that looks like what the framework will return.

-  Set up the adapter with very short delays (1ms)
-  Set up adapter to fail several times (mocks; maybe a good place to mock implementation)
-  Publish event to the subscriber
-  Expect the event to have retried several times, adapter to have been called several times, circuit breaker functions to have been called/run

The challenge is understanding what a connect failure error message from the framework looks like and identifying errors that are connect failures. I want to avoid duplicating that logic in each adapter, so may need functions per service.

## Plan

-  Build the circuit breaker; just a stubbed out skeleton
-  Write a test to see it trip on a connect failure
   -  Create adapter with circuit breaker
   -  Mock to get a connect failure
   -  Call adapter to trip the breaker
   -  Expect the breaker to be open, adapter called, error from adapter
-  Write a test to see it half open
   -  Induce open as above
   -  Mock to get connect ok
   -  Call adapter once
   -  Expect the breaker to be half open
-  Write a test to see it self-recover
   -  Induce open
   -  Mock to get connect ok
   -  Wait
   -  Expect breaker to be closed, expect runRetries to be called
-  Write a test to see it retry
   -  Need subscriber, use case, circuit breaker, adapter
      -  Use a test subscriber and use case
      -  Set up breaker to immediately trip to open on failure
   -  Mock to get connect failure
   -  Send event
   -  Expect `errorData` contents, expect breaker to be open; expect subscriber called once
   -  Call `addRetryEvent`
   -  Expect breaker to be open
   -  Mock adapter to succeed
   -  Expect breaker to be closed; expect subscriber called twice
-  Write test, watch it fail, write code to pass
