# Prisma BackupRequest repo

## Create the repo

I want to write a repo using Prisma so I can save data in the database.

[x] Create `src/backup-request/adapter/impl/PrismaBackupRequestRepo.ts`
[x] The class implements `IBackupRequestRepo`
[x] Write the `save()` method (it's the one I use in tests right now, so should be able to get data I can see)
   * use `upsert()`
[x] Write the `exists()` and `findById()` methods to fulfill the interface
[x] Write `mapToDomain()` and `mapToDb()` to translate between domain and raw/db

`exists()` should return a `Result<boolean, DatabaseError>` but I don't want to fix it right now, so I'm leaving it `boolean`. Added a story below to fix it.

Each method will create a `PrismaClient`, do whatever it needs to do, and disconnect the client. That's inefficient, but it's easy for now. Added a story to make it better.

### Test it

[x] Use `CreateBackupRequestUseCase.spec.ts`. Change the success case to use the new repo. Will write data to the database?
   * [Jest docs for `spyOn`](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) say it calls the spied method.

Prisma isn't finding the env file, so let's try it with `dotenv-cli`.

`npx dotenv -e ./env/test.env jest`

The test is failing now. Let's put some logging in the repo for now.

The problem is in `mapToDb()`. `backupJobId` is a `UniqueIdentifier`, need to get the `idValue` to return.

The test passed. Can we see data in `test.db`?

`npx dotenv -e ./env/test.env prisma studio`

Yes, we have a backup request that looks like the test's data.

It works!

**COMMIT 5.1.1 - ADD: BackupRequest repo using Prisma**

## Mock `PrismaClient` in a unit test

I want to mock `PrismaClient` the `...PRISMA` test I created above so I don't need to write data to the database to test my code.

See [Prisma testing docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing) for guidance.



## Move `PrismaClient` create/disconnect

I want to create the `PrismaClient` and disconnect from it outside the repo so the interface is more efficient.

For the application, that would happen at the beginning and as part of the shutdown.
Where should this happen for unit tests? (or should it)

## Fix `exists()` to return a `Result`

I want the repo `exists()` method to return a `Result` so I can handle database errors gracefully.

## Change all tests to use the Prisma repo implementation

I want to change all tests to use the `PrismaBackupRequestRepo` and mock `PrismaClient` so I don't need my fake repo to test.

## Build a Prisma repo for Backups

I want to build a `PrismaBackupRepo` for `Backup` data so I can write data to the database for `Backup`s.
