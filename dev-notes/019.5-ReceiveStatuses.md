# Change receive statuses to use the new event model

## What needs to be done?

Some of this was set up with work in 019.4, so start by reviewing the receive status process to see where it is.

**`rcvSrv` and `rcvApp`**

-  `rcvApp` calls `initQueueWatcher`
   -  Sets up the receive use case and subscriber for the in memory event bus
   -  Creates `AzureQueueWatcher` and starts it
-  `AzureQueueWatcher` takes a message handler and runs it for each message received
-  `AzureStoreStatusMessageHandler` creates a `StoreStatusReceived` event and publishes it
   -  It uses `eventBus.publishEvent`, so if `eventBus` is BullMq, it will publish to BullMq
-  `StoreStatusReceived` is mapped to the new style event, so should be good as is

**Differences that matter**

The subscriber

-  Accepts an event with dequeue count, message id, pop receipt, and a message object
-  Builds a DTO with data from the message object
-  Runs the use case with the DTO
-  Based on use case result or other conditions may delete the message from the queue

The `BullmqConsumer`

-  Accepts a use case
-  Runs the use case with the whole event
-  Based on the result may mark the job complete or retry it

So, the subscriber is smarter than the BullMq consumer because it has to be. In memory relies on Azure queue retries for persistence. BullMq gets persistence from Redis.

For BullMq, the `AzureStoreStatusMessageHandler` takes on subscriber responsibilities

-  Build the use case DTO into the event
-  Delete the message from the Azure queue because the event bus is persistent

## Plan

`AzureStoreStatusMessageHandler` needs to know the event bus type.

-  Call a function to build the event
-  `await` the event publish to know if it's ok
-  If BullMq, call a function to delete the message
-  When building the BullMq event, key by messageId to reduce risk of duplicates for the same message

## Notes

-  Add `StoreStatusReceived.mem.ts` for the in memory event - `StoreStatusReceived_MEM`
-  Add `StoreStatusReceived.bmq.ts` for the BullMq event - `StoreStatusReceived_BMQ`
-  Add `_deleteAzureMessage` to handle after publish behavior for BullMq based on publish result
-  Pull common SSR types into `StoreStatusReceived.common.ts`
-  Change subscriber to use `StoreStatusReceived_MEM`
-  In handler, create event and call `_deleteAzureMessage` based on `MESSAGE_BUS_TYPE`
-  Handler needs an `IBackupInterfaceStoreAdapter`, so requires a constructor

-  In `initQueueWatcher` create subscriber, use case, etc., for non-BullMq only

-  In `bmqWorker` add consumer for `StoreStatusReceived`

## Tests

-  `AzureStoreStatusMessageHandler` - needs interface adapter where it's used
-  `StoreStatusReceived` - import from correct place

Unit tests pass--but they don't test the BullMq version directly

Let's try to run it and see what happens.

-  Confirm `EVENT_BUS_TYPE` is set to BullMq
-  Start db and Redis (Docker)
-  Start Azurite queue
-  Clear Redis
-  Select request to test - `_X5lGXL-UgFofLBu7Mk7S`
-  Start queue watcher

Queue watcher gets errors trying to receive. This is probably related to the ECONNRESET issues noted in 017.1.

-  Start `queueHelper`
-  Post a status message for the request
-  Start the worker

Worker is failing because the event name is wrong (`_MEM`).

-  Change worker to look for `_BMQ` event (had not prefix)
-  Change handler to use `eventBusType` from `eventBus` (added export)
-  Type in Redis looks good now
-  Start worker

Use case is failing because invalid request status -- and it's the wrong use case

-  Create correct use case (and repo it needs)
-  Add use case type to `BullmqConsumer` use cases allowed
-  Start worker -- and queue watcher
-  Worker says it's okay, check data
-  Data looks good
-  Also, I ended up with two messages for the same request and data looks good
-  Try another request -- data looks good
-  Try a failed request -- data looks good (request failed, no backup created)

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: change queue watcher and receive status parts to work with the BullMq event bus**
