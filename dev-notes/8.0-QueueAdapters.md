## Queue adapters

I need to build adapters that can talk to the queues linebacker will use to send create messages to the backup interface and receive status messages from the backup interface.

## Planning

The "send" adapter should take a backup request, build a message to send to the queue, and send the message.

-  Currently, the interface returns a boolean; need to handle errors or similar situations, so will probably promote it to a `Result`
-  I'm using Azure Storage queues as my first target
-  For initial "get it working," I'll connect to a local Azurite queue
-  For unit testing, I'll figure out how to mock the connection
-  I want some code that the adapter uses that will
   -  Manage connections to the queue
   -  If the queue is unavailable, act as a sort of circuit breaker
   -  Keep a list of messages awaiting send (if circuit breaker is open/connection not possible)
   -  Send waiting messages when the circuit breaker closes/connection established
   -  Point being: don't put the reliability complexity in the adapter if possible

The "receive" adapter is a controller (receives a message, does basic checks, calls the receive use case).

-  As above, I want to put the Azure connection and polling in code that calls the queue controller/adapter--sort of "Fastify/Express-alike for Azure Storage queues"
-  The controller is a message handler that gets hooked up to the framework for queues

I'll focus on the "send" adapter and Azure code behind that first, then come back and plan the "receive" adapter

-  Use the Azure SDK to build the lower level send process
-  The goal is a method the adapter can call to send a message and get a status back
   -  That method should manage connection, circuit breaker behaviors, etc.
-  Use that to get the adapter working (Azurite)
-  Write unit tests that mock the lower level method
-  Work on circuit breaker and holding pending messages
-  I want to initialize the connection on server startup, I think
   -  Cache credentials in the lower level code
-  Look at some of the Azure queue packages people have built on npm
   -  Some are old, but they're a source of ideas
   -  `azure-abstract-queue-adapter`, `azure-storage-simple`, `tsdatautils-azurestoragequeue` (ideas)
   -  I think I already have much of this in code I hacked together figuring out Azure Storage queues, but could be better organized

What information does the lower level code need?

-  Credentials to connect (may need to be able to refresh while running)
-  Storage account information
-  Queue name
-  I want to be able to use different queues, so need a way to identify the queue
   -  Queue identifier is storage account + queue name, so define a logical identifier the adapter can use and the low level code can look up
   -  Register all queues on startup

8.1 - Initial send adapter sketch

-  Write the adapter knowing it won't work yet, but get a feel for what it needs to do
-  I may have one or a mock one already, see if anything there is useful

8.2 - Plan how to keep this code out of linebacker

-  Easy way is to build in a separate repo, maybe link repo to linebacker
-  Or monorepo??
-  Need to do some research

8.3 - Low level code for send

8.4 - Connect adapter to low level code

8.5 - Receive controller

-  Gets a message DTO and runs the receive use case
-  Should be able to unit test it directly

8.6 - Low level code for receive

-  Need to decide how I start a poller running
-  Separate initialize, start, stop methods
   -  Initialize needs to register handler
   -  Start needs to be async, but not awaited so it runs in the background
   -  May want to run in a separate worker (but node docs say they're aimed at CPU not I/O, this should be mostly I/O)
