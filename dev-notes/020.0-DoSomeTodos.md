# Do some items from the main TODO list

-  [x] Create a configuration object singleton that builds itself from `process.env`
   -  Move all `process.env` values that matter, `dotenv`, etc., into the singleton
   -  Structure it sanely; use everywhere
   -  Revamp `.env` files as needed
   -  For BullMq/Redis
      -  Queue settings are hard coded in `publish`; retry count should be large
      -  Custom backoff policy that increments to a max and then stays at that max
      -  Connection details
-  [x] In `AzureQueue.receiveMessages()`, make the visibility timeout configurable
   -  From environment or from caller as a parameter (TBD)
-  [x] Production and `pm2` readiness
   -  [x] When application `AbortController` fires, delay long enough for things to shut down
   -  [x] Also need `pm2` graceful shutdown/start behavior
   -  [x] Replace `FakeAuthNZ` with carefully guarded test handling in auth middlewares so we don't need `test-helpers` in `dist`
-  Go through [I, Azure, Mock]BISA adapters and ensure return types make sense; clean up as needed
-  [x] Update packages

# Update packages

| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| fastify | 3.29.4  | 3.29.4 | 4.10.2 | node_modules/fastify | Currently focused on Express; will update later            |
| got     | 11.8.6  | 11.8.6 | 12.5.3 | node_modules/got     | got 12 requires ESM, which doesn't play nice with my setup |

Removed `dotenv-cli` and `@types/uuid` dev dependencies because I don't see where I'm using them and removing doesn't break tests or running.

-  Run unit tests
   -  `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` api changed, breaking some tests -- fix (so tests aren't failing)
-  Build and run application
   -  Added `bmqWorker` to the `pm2` configuration
   -  Added `process.send('ready')` to `bmqWorker` startup
   -  Accepting requests and processing them as expected, so all seems well

**COMMIT: CHORE: update packages; fix unit test issues caused by upgrade**
