## Which ORM?

Prisma or TypeORM
* Both are aimed at TypeScript. Both are multi-database. Both work with Fastify, NestJS, and others.
* Prisma
   * Custom-generates a client module in `node_modules`, so I'm curious how that works on deploy. I'm guessing they generate it at deploy based on the models, etc., in the repo.
   * Schema files are easy to read. Data source (connection) is coded in the file, but I can change it at run time, including provider (I think). So I can set up an environment file for dev, prod, etc.
   * Getting started seems complex based on the docs, but maybe a quick project would prove otherwise.
* TypeORM
   * Don't need a custom module, everything defined in ORM code.
   * Decorator based model definitions are harder to read.
   * Connection not specified in the model. Changing it at run time looks like more work than Prisma
* Others
   * Sequelize has good TS support, but [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/best-typescript-orms) says it uses "runtime property assignments for manual type declarations to work with models"
   * Objection is more a query builder
   * Mikro-orm offers different model defintion tools ranging from `reflect-metadata` (TypeOrm uses) to something more like TS that is nevertheless not as simple as Prisma's schemas. It may have some advanced features, but I don't know that they make sense for this application.

I think I'll try to figure out Prisma. If that goes well, I'll use it. If it proves more challenging to get started than I expected, I'll try TypeORM.

## Setup
```bash
npm install --save-dev prisma

npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
```

**Output**
```
âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

warn You already have a .gitignore. Don't forget to exclude .env to not commit any secret.

Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
3. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

Creates `prisma/schema.prisma` as described.

I'm also installing the VS Code Prisma extensions.

### .env files
It also creates a `.env` in the project root. I removed it and created `./env/test.env`. Based on [Prisma SQLite docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite), I think the path is relative to the `prisma` directory. We'll see.

```
PORT=3000

DATABASE_URL="file:../env/test.db"
```

I also have a `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db`, in `./env/dev.env`, which I'll adjust later. 

### Backup request model
I'll define the backup request in `./prisma/schema.prisma`.

```
model BackupRequest {
  backupRequestId           String      @id @unique @map("BackupRequestIdentifier")
  backupJobId               String      @map("BackupJobIdentifier")
  dataDate                  DateTime    @map("DataDate")
  preparedDataPathName      String      @map("PreparedDataPathName")
  getOnStartFlag            Boolean     @map("GetOnStartFlag")
  transportTypeCode         String      @map("TransportTypeCode")
  backupProviderCode        String?     @map("BackupProviderCode")
  storagePathName           String?     @map("StoragePathName")
  statusTypeCode            String      @map("StatusTypeCode")
  receivedTimestamp         DateTime    @map("ReceivedTimestamp")
  checkedTimestamp          DateTime?   @map("CheckedTimestamp")
  sentToInterfaceTimestamp  DateTime?   @map("SentToInterfaceTimestamp")
  replyTimestamp            DateTime?   @map("ReplyTimestamp")
  requesterId               String?     @map("RequesterIdentifier")
  replyMessageText          String?     @map("ReplyMessageText")
}
```

Notes:
* All column names in the database should be Pascal case, so I've used `@map()` to rename them. 
* The `?` suffix identifies an optional (nullable) column. 
* I may come back and change some `String` types to `db.VarChar(x)` types

### Generate the database

`npx prisma db push` gets an error because I moved the `.env` file. According to [Prisma env file docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/development-environment/environment-variables/using-multiple-env-files), the answer is to use `dotenv-cli` and set up scripts in `package.json`.

`npm install --save-dev dotenv-cli`

Now `npx dotenv -e ./env/dev.env prisma db push` -- creates `./prisma/dev.db`. Using `test.env` puts `test.db` in `./env`.
And `npx dotenv -e ./env/[dev|test].env prisma studio` gives me a browser GUI for the data.

I'm adding `*.db` to `.gitignore`.

So, that seems to be working at a basic level.

I'll wait to set up scripts in `package.json` until I decide what I need. Probably something to initialize/migrate, possibly something to run tests, though I see the Prisma [unit testing docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing) recommend mocking the client. I'll look into that soon.

**COMMIT: 5.0.1 - RESEARCH: select ORM; get started with Prisma**
