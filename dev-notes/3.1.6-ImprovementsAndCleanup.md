# Improvements and cleanup

## Dates
[x] Make date getters consistent everywhere.
Added `dateOrUndefinedAsDate()` to get a date or undefined.

[x] Places where I convert a date to a string may get an invalid date string. What to do about that?
Added checks to `dateOrUndefinedAsDate()` to ensure string values are valid dates.

[x] add tests for `dateOrUndefinedAsDate()`

## Type values
I'd like to move away from hardcoded string values for type values, but I see a lot of "avoid enums" arguments.

I need to export an object from the types so I can use `typeObject.typeValue` and avoid the risk of changing values.

I think I can export the object in each of my types, just need to come up with a naming convention.

[x] Replace hardcoded constants with references to "enum" objects.

**COMMIT - 3.1.6.1 - REFACTOR: date checking; avoid hardcoded strings for type values**

## Error responses
[] Add error types and expand `Response` left options to include them for all domain entities/aggregates.

I really want to return an error object with a message and an optional object containing data about the error.
