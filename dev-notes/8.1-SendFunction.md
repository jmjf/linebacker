# Send to Azure queue function

## Plan

From 8.0

-  Get credentials
   -  Assume we set up env because that's the smart move for security
-  Create a queue client
   -  Needs a queue name, but assume we put all the send queues in one storage account so can get from env
   -  Options should default always
-  Set up the message
   -  Ensure the queue exists
   -  Base64 the message
   -  Call `queueClient.sendMessage()`
      -  If it fails, no need to retry right away because we just got credentials and connected the client so it's a real failure.
   -  Return the `Result`
   -  Put that function in `common/infrastructure/AzureQueue.ts`, which can include helper functions so send isn't giant
      -  May be exported functions for key operations
      -  Could be a static object

## How does it succeed/fail?

-  Get credentials
   -  Succeed -> proceed
   -  Fail -> environment variables missing (5 variables to test); err
      -  InfrastructureErrors.InvalidInput(`{msg: 'Invalid input', input: 'environment ${envVarName}'}`)
   -  Constructor doesn't look like it can throw; doesn't actually connect to Azure, so no need to test for that, I think.
-  Create queue client
   -  Succeed -> proceed
   -  Fail -> undefined queue name; err
      -  InfrastructureErrors.InvalidInput(`{msg: 'Invalid input', input: 'queueName'}`)
   -  Fail -> undefined account URI; err
      -  InfrastructureErrors.InvalidInput(`{msg: 'Invalid input', input: 'accountUri'}`)
      -  Will this come from env or will it be passed?
   -  Constructor doesn't look like it can throw; no actual Azure connection
-  Send message
   -  Succeed -> returns ok and some data about what was written
   -  Fail -> Message is empty; return err InterfaceErrors.InvalidInput(`{msg: 'Invalid input', input: 'messageText'}`)
   -  Fail -> Message isn't a string; can ignore this, I think
      -  `Buffer.from()` throws a `TypeError` if the message isn't a string; I think we can trust TypeScript and the adapter process to protect against this.
      -  `messageText: string`
   -  Fail -> `sendMessage` can throw
      -  Calls messagesContext.enqueue
         -  Can throw if no URI -- protect against in create queue client (where URI built)
         -  InvalidInput(`{msg: 'Invalid input', input: 'sendMessage throws because baseURI in SDK HTTP client is invalid'}`)
         -  Rest of HTTP client catches errors and rejects (`Promise.reject()`) -- await sees as a throw, so handle in catch

Send message should call get credentials and create queue client, so can test it alone to cover the other two.

-  [x] When invalid AUTH_METHOD, it returns an err
-  [x] When missing environment variable $envVarName, it returns an err
   -  Credentials -> AD requires 3; shared key requires 2, varies by credential type
-  [x] When queueName is invalid, it returns an err
   -  defined, string, length > 0
-  [x] When account URI is invalid, it returns an err
   -  defined, string, length > 0
   -  URI must look like https://{accountName}.queue.core.windows.net
   -  Regex as template string: `^https://[a-z0-9]{3,24}.queue.core.windows.net`
-  [x] When message text is invalid, it returns an err
   -  Check defined, string, length > 0 in a single check and just call it "invalid"; covers risk of `Buffer.from()` throwing
-  When sendMessage throws an error, it catches the error and returns an err
-  When sendMessage rejects, it catches the error and returns an err
-  When sendMessage resolves, it returns ok with a send result

**COMMIT: DOCS: plan queue adapters and send function**

## Build it

-  `npm install @azure/identity @azure/storage-queue`
-  Create `common/infrastructure/AzureQueue.ts`; build minimum skeleton
-  Write missing env var test for `getCredential`; see it fail
-  Get it to pass
-  Cover all 5 env values for `getCredential`
-  Add check for AUTH_METHOD from the env; will vary in local vs. connecting to Azure so avoid hardcoding it
-  Add tests for account uri; see it fail; get it to pass
-  Add test for queue name; see it fail; get it to pass
-  Add test for message txt; see it fail; get it to pass

**COMMIT: FEAT: (incomplete) sendMessage; input checks, partial functionality**
