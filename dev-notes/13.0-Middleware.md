# Middleware rework and extension

## Goals

-  Express focus; fastify will happen later
-  All middleware in plain JS
-  Separate trace id from pinomor
-  Pass logger to pinomor instead of assuming
-  Add authn middleware
-  Add authz middleware (using database authz data)
-  Define types for each middleware's request object result so you can build a composite request for TS code

## Use JS for middleware

Because each middleware is simple, small and will rarely need chances, so TS overhead isn't needed.

In `tsconfig.json`, add to `include` `src/infrastructure/middleware/*.js`.

All middleware exported through `src/infrastructure/middleware/index.js` and types through `index.d.ts`.

## Separate trace id

The `pinomor` module I built for request logging adds a trace id to the request. Pull trace id into a separate middleware.

Result is `src/infrastructure/middleware/tracerizer.js`.

```typescript
const opts: TracerizerOptions = {
	reqTraceIdKey: string;
	// Required
	// name of the key to add to the request to hold the trace id
};

const tracerizer = buildTracerizer( opts );
```

## Pass logger to pinomor

-  Convert to JS
-  eslint complains about BigInt(); add `es2020: true` to `env` in `.eslintrc.js`

```typescript
const opts: PinomorOptions = {
	log: (obj: object, msg?: string | undefined) => void;
	// Required
	// the function pinomor uses to log request data
	// Choose the log level by choosing the appropriate function from your logger
	// or wrap a logger that doesn't conform in a function to adapt it.

	reqStartTimeKey: string;
	// Required
	// the name of the key to add to request to hold start time
	// Used to calculate total request time on request finish.

	reqTraceIdKey?: string;
	// Optional
	//	the name of the key from which to get the request's trace id
	// If not defined, the trace id will not be logged.

	reqGetStartFromKey?: string;
	// Optional
	// If setting a BigInt request start time in earlier middleware,
	// the key of the request object that holds the start time.
	// Useful when putting tracerizer ahead of pinomor because tracerizer
	// uses hrTime as a trace id, so is a better start time than "now."
};

const pinomor = buildPinomor( opts );
```

## Convert json body error handler to JS

```typescript
const opts: PinomorOptions = {
	log: (obj: object, msg?: string | undefined) => void;
	// Required
	// the function to use when logging request data
	// Choose the log level by choosing the appropriate function from your logger
	// or wrap a logger that doesn't conform in a function to adapt it.

	reqTraceIdKey?: string;
	// Optional
	//	the name of the key from which to get the request's trace id
	// If not defined, the trace id will not be logged.

};

const jsonBodyErrorHandler = buildJsonBodyErrorHandler( opts );
```

## Authnerizer

I have some unique authentication requirements for reasons.

-  Clients must provide OAuth id tokens (no authorization claims) as bearer tokens in the Authorization header
-  Token public keys are not available through JWKS or a "wellknown" endpoint (uses a custom endpoint)
-  Keys may be issued by different issuers with different urls

AuthN middleware should take

-  Options for `fast-jwt`, which I'll use to verify and decode tokens
-  A function to retrieve token public keys
   -  This could be something like `get-jwks.getPublicKey` or a custom function
   -  The function should be async and return a Promise
   -  The function will cache keys with a ttl
      -  Stale keys stay in the cache on non-404 error from key provider
      -  Consider using mnemonist's LRU and handling ttl in caching functions
      -  Or consider @isaacs/ttlcache and don't worry about LRU
   -  Function accepts a token that includes `kid` and `alg` members
   -  Pattern on `get-jwks.getPublicKey`
   -  On config, can I include key endpoint(s) or suffix to add to `iss`?
   -  Options
      -  maxCache, ttl, allowedDomains (or domain to endpoint map)

Question: Does the token `fast-jwt` passes to the function include `iss`? (Check this.)

-  No. Testing shows it only includes `alg`, `typ`, and `kid`.
-  This makes a sort of sense if you don't trust the `iss` to give you a reliable issuer until it's verified
   -  Someone could forge `iss` and point you to their own JWKS or similar
   -  But isn't that why we have `allowedDomains`?
-  In the example for `@fastify/jwt` it does have `iss` available to pass as the domain
   -  `@fastify/jwt` decodes the token and passes the full decoded token to the verifier
   -  It creates the verifier on the fly
-  So
   -  Get the token from the Authorization header
   -  Decode the token and get the `iss`
   -  Create the verifier using the `iss` as the domain
      -  Ensure `opts.allowedDomains` includes `iss`

```typescript
export interface AuthnerizerOptions {
	allowedIssuers: string[];
	fastjwtVerifierOptions: VerifierOptions;
	getPublicKey: (token: string) => Promise<string>;
	logError: (obj: object, msg?: string) => void;
	reqTraceIdKey?: string;
}
const opts: AuthnerizerOptions = {
	allowedIssuers: string[];
	// Required
	// allowed values for the iss member of the token body
	// Tokens with iss not in this list will be rejected. Must not be an empty array.
	// Authnerizer checks before creating the fast-jwt verifier.

	fastjwtVerifierOptions?: VerifierOptions;
	// Optional
	// options to pass to fast-jwt's createVerifier
	// Authnerizer requires and overrides the following values { key: getPublicKey, complete: true }
	// All other values will be passed through

	getPublicKey // TBD if really needed

	logError: (obj: object, msg?: string | undefined) => void;
	// Required
	// the function to use when logging authentication errors
	// Choose the log level by choosing the appropriate function from your logger
	// or wrap a logger that doesn't conform in a function to adapt it.

	reqTraceIdKey?: string;
	// Optional
	//	the name of the key from which to get the request's trace id
	// If not defined, the trace id will not be logged.

};

const jsonBodyErrorHandler = buildJsonBodyErrorHandler( opts );
```

While writing the call docs above, I spotted a few problems.

-  If I create the verifier for each call, I lose `fast-jwt`'s caching benefits
-  The `getPublicKey` parmeter needs to be a factory that returns a `getPublicKey` function for a given `iss`
-  Then I can build a `Map` that lets me look up the right verifier for a given `iss` in the middleware
-  BUT, before I add that complexity, I need to check on some details
   -  My IdP has < 10 issuers
   -  It may use the same keys for all `iss`; if so I could use one source for public keys
   -  In which case I can create the verifier in the build and use the same `getPublicKey` for all
   -  Or maybe remove `getPublicKey` and code it in the middleware

For now, I think the middleware is reasonably solid except for that consideration.
