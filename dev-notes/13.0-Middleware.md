# Middleware rework and extension

## Goals

-  Express focus; fastify will happen later
-  All middleware in plain JS
-  Separate trace id from pinomor
-  Pass logger to pinomor instead of assuming
-  Add authn middleware
-  Add authz middleware (using database authz data)
-  Define types for each middleware's request object result so you can build a composite request for TS code
