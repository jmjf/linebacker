# Circuit breaker and delayed event runner improvements

## Motivation

Circuit breaker only attempts to run retry events if it moves from open to closed. If a circuit breaker is set to allow > 1 failure before tripping to open (as is likely to be true in a production scenario), events set up for retry won't run if the circuit breaker never trips.

`onSuccess()` will need to try to run events

## DER -- don't run events if already running

`DelayedEventRunner.runEvents()` sets the state to run on start. If `onSuccess()` calls `runEvents()`, it could lead to `runEvents()` being called while it's running.

Plan

-  In `runEvents()` if state is run or no events, return
-  When running events finishes set state to stop (new state) so it won't be in run when `runEvents()` starts next time

States

-  Run - loop is running
-  Stop - loop is done or stopped by external process
-  Halt - abort signal received, stop loop; shutting down

## CB - call runEvents() from onSuccess()

Calling `runEvents()` from `onSuccess()` ensures that the next successful call to the service will run any events set up for retry. Changes to `runEvents()` above will ensure the `runEvents()` loop runs once and only once.

## How to test

DER gets a test suite

-  [x] when no events are set up for retry, runEvents() does nothing
-  [x] when events are set up for retry and DER is in run state, runEvents() does nothing
-  [x] when events are set up for retry and DER is in stop state, runEvents() runs events

New test for CB

-  [x] when CB is closed and events are set up for retry, onSuccess() causes events to run

The closed test covers half open too because `runEvents()` call is outside conditions for different states

## Other

Found an error in `ExpressCreateBackupRequestController` tests -- wasn't setting authZ data right for fakeAuthNZ, getting 403 errors

All tests pass.

**COMMIT: FIX: ensure retry events run when CircuitBreaker is Closed or Half Open**
