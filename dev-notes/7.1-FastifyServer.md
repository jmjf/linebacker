# Get a Fastify server running

## Plan

-  Build a server for Fastify and accept HTTP calls
-  Use Postgres in a container for Prisma
   -  Need a Docker setup for this; use `docker-compose` and include adminer
-  See log output that shows linebacker is handling them correctly

## PostgreSQL container

-  Pulled docker setup from another project I have that uses Postgres and adminer
-  Added environment variables to env/dev.env
-  `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose/dev.env up`
-  Confirm I can connect adminer to the pg instance

## Connect Prisma to Postgres

-  Upgraded Prisma to 4.x
   -  After reviewing upgrade guide, I shouldn't have any issues, but we'll see
-  Prisma requires an environment variable with the Postgres connection string
   -  Added to protected env file
-  Prisma wants the environment file in specific (unprotected) places, so add `**/*.env` to `.gitignore`
-  `npx prisma generate` to create the client
-  `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` to generate the initial migration
-  See the pg database now has the tables

## Ensure Prisma upgrade didn't break anything (tests still pass)

-  Tests use a mock Prisma instance, so in theory, may break if Prisma isn't happy (or maybe not, but we'll run them anyway)
-  All pass, so if anything is broken, it isn't obvious yet

**COMMIT: 7.1.1 - CHORE: set up Postgres; get Prisma talking to it; use Prisma to generate the db**

## Build a Fastify server

-  `fastifyApp.ts` gives me a `buildApp()` that needs to be used to launch a server
-  Write `fastifyServer.ts`
   -  Reference: https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Guides/Testing, https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Guides/Getting-Started
   -  I need to `await` a Prisma connection in the server startup, so change `tsconfig.json` to use ESNext to allow it
      -  Tests pass, so at a basic level this doesn't seem to have broken anything
-  Trying to run it, I need `"type": "module"` in `package.json`
-  After a lot of searching, reading SO, GH, etc., it looks like node and ts-node are kind of struggling with this
   -  GH comment that worked for me: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1062#issuecomment-1028139483
   -  Except `APP_ENV=dev node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --loader ts-node/esm src/fastifyServer.ts` because I need APP_ENV
      -  Tried `ts-node --esm` which someone else on the GH thread suggested, but it `cannot find module .../src/fastifyApp` even though I'm looking at it right beside
      -  Tried without the `--experimental*`, but gets the same error as trying to run with `ts-node --esm`
      -  I'm also seeing issues with compiled output not wanting to run (problems importing modules that are visible in `./dist`)
   -  This seems to be an ssue that causes many people pain and needs to be better explained/resolved or simplified
-  Add `fastify:dev` script to `package.json`

I think a lot of this comes down to the transition from CJS to ESM modules and the current challenges that has.

So, let's fire up Insomnia and create a test request to send.

```json
{
	"apiVersion": "2022-05-22",
	"backupJobId": "993aca31-453c-4c6c-878a-82551e2310a1",
	"dataDate": "2022-05-30",
	"backupDataLocation": "data-location"
}
```

It's saying route not found

-  Route was named `backup-request` when my prefered pattern is `backup-requests` (plural)
-  Fixed in Fastify and Express versions
-  Now it responds as expected and I see a row in the database
-  Server output shows the BackupRequestCreated event was created, but I don't see evidence the check allowed use case ran
   -  Look into that tomorrow

**COMMIT: FEAT: build Fastify server that can accept requests and update the database**

## Understanding the module problem

I spent some time reading about the issues I ran into last night, looking beyond the normal sources (including reading node docs on the module resolution algorithm).

-  The problem is due to the current state of node's support for ESM
   -  The node team has been working on ESM support for at least a couple of years now, so resolution may take a while.
-  If `"type": "module"` -> ESM, you can use top level `import` and `await`, but must include `.js` extensions on all imports from a relative path
-  If no `"type": "module"` -> CJS, no `.js` extension required, but no top level `import` or `await`
   -  One post had notes on VSCode settings that would do that automatically and a search/replace RegEx that would fix existing files
-  The node team seems to be working on improving the situation (so maybe ESM won't require)
-  Current TypeScript guidance leans toward running node in CJS style

Based on what I'm seeing, I have two options

-  Run node in ESM mode and use the `--experimental*` option
   -  If I think about running a production application, using an experimental feature
   -  The node docs say the option is likely to go away when they resolve ESM
   -  This option works now, but feels like a less good answer overall
-  Run node in ESM mode and add `.js` extensions to everything
   -  How does `.js` affect ts-node
   -  When node solves ESM, I'd want to strip the `.js` extensions
   -  Adding `.js` to refer to `.ts` feels counterintuitive
-  Run node in CJS mode and add a thin layer over the current top level
   -  Change `fastifyServer.ts` to export a function that starts the server; can `import`, `await`, etc.
   -  Add `fastifyIndex.ts` that uses `require()` to import the startup function and runs it.

I'm going to create a small test project to experiment. I'll confirm I can replicate the issue and document how different options work here.

### Test project (not included here)

-  `npm init` the project; `npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node`; `npm install chalk@4`
   -  chalk 4 is a CJS module and is a simple thing to import and use
-  Get the node 18 strictest config from GitHub (typescript bases)
   -  Add `"outDir": "./dist"`, `"includes": ["./src/**/*.ts"]`, `"excludes": ["./node_modules", "./dist"]`
-  Write a simple test program

```typescript
// src/hello.ts
import chalk from 'chalk';

export const sayHello = () => {
	console.log(chalk.red('Hello world!'));
};

// src/index.ts
import { sayHello } from './hello';

sayHello();
```

-  `npx ts-node src/index.ts` -- runs okay
-  `npx tsc` and `node dist/index.ts` -- runs okay

-  Change `tsconfig.json` -> `"module": "nodeNext", "moduleResolution": "nodeNext"`

   -  `ts-node` and `tsc ; node` work

-  Change `package.json` -> add `"type": "module"`

   -  `ts-node` reports unknown module on `index.ts`
   -  `tsc` reports "need js"

-  Change `index.ts`

   -  Add `.js` extension
   -  `ts-node` reports unknown module on `index.ts`; `npx ts-node src/index.js` gets a Node "module not found"
   -  `tsc ; node` works

-  Revert `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` to original

   -  `tsconfig.json` -> `"module": "commonJS", "moduleResolution": "node"`
   -  `package.json` -> remove `"type": "module"`
   -  `ts-node` fails because `hello.js`
   -  Remove `.js` -> `ts-node` works
   -  `tsc ; node` works

-  Change `hello` to be `async`, call with `await`
   -                    VS Code tells me it won't work (top level await not allowed)
   -  `ts-node` fails because top level `await`; `tsc` fails because top level `await`
   -  Remove `await` in `index.ts` -> `ts-node` works, `tsc ; node` works
      -  But if `sayHello()` did an async call that returned something I needed (like connecting to a database, etc.), I'd need to wrap the setup in a wrapper function and call that wrapper in `index.ts` without `await` to ensure it runs
   -  BUT, I can `import`, which is good to know

DECISION:

-  `tsconfig.json` -> `"module": "commonJS", "moduleResolution": "node"`
-  `package.json` -> NO `"type": "module"`
-  Write the server startup in a function; call the function
-  Works with `ts-node`
-  `tsc ; node` complains because I'm importing `fastifyApp` as `../src/fastifyApp` (part of trying to hack it last night)
   -  Importing `./fastifyApp`
   -  `tsc ; node` works now
-  Change `fastify:dev` script to remove `experimental*` option
   -  Works

Problems solved for now! (Yay!!!!)

**COMMIT: 7.1.3 - FIX: test and settle issues with module resolution**

## Fix events not triggering next use case

This is Stemmler's import tree in his base `index.ts`

-  `shared/infra/http/app`
   -  Sets up and starts the Express server
   -  Includes importing routes from modules
-  `shared/infra/database/sequelize`
   -  IIFE to set up Sequelize hooks for event hub
-  `modules/forum/subscriptions`
   -  Creates the event subscribers and ties them to their use cases
   -  Set of bare `new <subscriber>(<use-case>)`

What I have is a little different

-  `fastifyServer`
   -  Get environment
   -  Connect Prisma
   -  Build the server (`fastifyApp`)
   -  Start the server

I want a method that will subscribe so I can call it where it makes sense, probably as part of building the server. I need to do something like

```typescript
new BackupRequestCreatedSubscriber(
	new CheckRequestAllowedUseCase({
		backupRequestRepo: repo,
		backupJobServiceAdapter: backupJobServiceAdapter,
	})
);

new BackupRequestAllowedSubscriber(
	new SendRequestToInterfaceUseCase({
		backupRequestRepo: repo,
		backupInterfaceAdapter: backupInterfaceAdapterFactory(),
	})
);
```

which means I need the repo and adapters.

I'm using the code below in `fastifyRoutes` to create the objects needed for the POST.

```typescript
const prismaBackupRequestRepo = new PrismaBackupRequestRepo(prismaCtx);
const createBackupRequestUseCase = new CreateBackupRequestUseCase(prismaBackupRequestRepo);
const fastifyCreateBackupRequestController = new FastifyCreateBackupRequestController(createBackupRequestUseCase);
```

Stemmler has an `index.ts` for each use case that creates the use case and exports it. It uses `index.ts` files from the repos that create the repo and export it. His `subscriptions/index.ts` imports the use cases and uses them. He does similar with his routes setup. The whole thing makes a sort of sense, but is a little confusing and hard to trace through. I'd like to make it simpler.

My challenge is, `addBackupRequestRoutes()` in `fastifyRoutes` is creating the repo, use case and controller. I need to move those out of the function and export them to make them shareable. I also need a function to create the subscriptions using the same references. I don't want to put that in `fastifyRoutes` because it should be generic.

I think I'll create a module that creates everything. It needs to be bare/top-level (not wrapped in a function) and export the things it creates. `fastifyRoutes` can import the controllers it needs from that module. I can also write a subscriber function that uses the same.

I believe the best place for this is in `src/backup-request/infrastructure` and flatten that directory (get rid of `http`).

### Plan

-  Move `fastifyRoutes` and `expressRoutes` from `.../infrastructure/http` to `.../infrastructure`
-  Add a module (name TBD) to hold all the things we need to create (repo, use cases, controllers) and set up subscriptions
   -  Key point to consider: some use cases will need things that are from other modules
      -  Check allowed needs a backup job service adapter from backup-job
      -  Receive status needs a backup repo from backup
      -  Need to import from those modules to avoid duplication
-  Import the module in the two routes modules and use it to create the routes

### Actions

-  Move contents of `.../infrastructure/http` to `.../infrastructure`
   -  Fix tests that used `backup-request` route--I renamed it last night
-  Create `.../infrastructure/initBackupRequestModule`
   -  Accepts `prismaCtx` (for repos) and `controllerType: 'Fastify' | 'Express'`
   -  Based on controller type, returns the right controller
   -  Exports a same-name function that returns the objects it creates with generic names (no prisma, fastify, express prefixes)
-  Use in `fastifyRoutes`
   -  I only need the controller
   -  Because the controller can be either a Fastify controller or an Express controller, I need to cast it to use it
-  Confirm tests are still passing
-  Run `fastify:dev` it accepts a request, returns a reasonable response, and updates the database--so far, so good
-  Need to add the check if allowed use case and subscribe it
   -  Needs a `BackupJobServiceAdapter`
   -  Make `backup-job` a module (move out of `backup`) and fix imports
   -  Create `MockBackupJobServiceAdapter` to return a `BackupJob` -- same data every time except use the id passed
   -  For now, use the mock adapter in `initBackupRequestModule`; in the future pass it
   -  Create the `CheckRequestAllowedUseCase` and the subscriber
   -  Fix tests to use `backup-job` path where needed
-  Tests are passing; I'm seeing evidence the check events may be running
-  Run `fastify:dev` and post a request
   -  Logging suggests the event is running
   -  Data in the database says the event is running -- request status is Allowed

**COMMIT: 7.1.4 - FEAT: subscribe to BackupRequestCreated events for CheckRequestAllowedUseCase for Fastify**

Just to prove it's working, I added a 10 second delay to the adapter's return and ran `fastify:dev`

-  Submit a request
-  Get a result
-  Select data - status = Received
-  Wait
-  Select data - status = Allowed

That test proves that the event processing runs asynchronously from the request processing (request returns before event completes), which was the goal.

-  Comment out the delay in the adapter
-  Create `prismaCtx` in `src/common/infrastructure/prismaContext`
   -  Benefits the server that can now import it and not need to create it themselves
   -  Can't import elsewhere because `buildApp` needs to be able to accept a mock repo or a real repo

Now, time to get the send to interface subscription running.

-  Needs a `BackupRequestRepo`, which I have, and a `BackupRequestBackupInterfaceAdapter`
   -  For now, build a mock adapter
   -  Later, will use Azurite for local testing when running the server
-  Create the interface adapter and the use case
   -  Include the use case in the init result
-  Add the subscription

It's probably worth noting that the subscribers get created in the init method, which would normally take them out of scope when the method ends. BUT, the subscriber registers itself with the event bus, so it stays in scope as long as the event bus exists. The event bus is a static object, so exists as long as the application is running. I believe the entire init closure will stay in scope as a result. That isn't really an issue because all the objects init creates stay in scope while the application is running.

Put delays in both mock adapters and run `fastify:dev`

-  Submit a request, get a result, select data = Received
-  Wait for server to log event ran, select data = Allowed
-  Wait for server to log event ran, select data = Sent

It's working.

-  Comment out delays

**COMMIT: 7.1.5 - FEAT: subscribe to BackupRequestAllowed events for SentRequestToInterfaceUseCase for Fastify**
