# Get a Fastify server running

## Plan

-  Build a server for Fastify and accept HTTP calls
-  Use Postgres in a container for Prisma
   -  Need a Docker setup for this; use `docker-compose` and include adminer
-  See log output that shows linebacker is handling them correctly

## PostgreSQL container

-  Pulled docker setup from another project I have that uses Postgres and adminer
-  Added environment variables to env/dev.env
-  `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose/dev.env up`
-  Confirm I can connect adminer to the pg instance

## Connect Prisma to Postgres

-  Upgraded Prisma to 4.x
   -  After reviewing upgrade guide, I shouldn't have any issues, but we'll see
-  Prisma requires an environment variable with the Postgres connection string
   -  Added to protected env file
-  Prisma wants the environment file in specific (unprotected) places, so add `**/*.env` to `.gitignore`
-  `npx prisma generate` to create the client
-  `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` to generate the initial migration
-  See the pg database now has the tables

## Ensure Prisma upgrade didn't break anything (tests still pass)

-  Tests use a mock Prisma instance, so in theory, may break if Prisma isn't happy (or maybe not, but we'll run them anyway)
-  All pass, so if anything is broken, it isn't obvious yet

**COMMIT: 7.1.1 - CHORE: set up Postgres; get Prisma talking to it; use Prisma to generate the db**

## Build a Fastify server

-  `fastifyApp.ts` gives me a `buildApp()` that needs to be used to launch a server
-  Write `fastifyServer.ts`
   -  Reference: https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Guides/Testing, https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Guides/Getting-Started
   -  I need to `await` a Prisma connection in the server startup, so change `tsconfig.json` to use ESNext to allow it
      -  Tests pass, so at a basic level this doesn't seem to have broken anything
-  Trying to run it, I need `"type": "module"` in `package.json`
-  After a lot of searching, reading SO, GH, etc., it looks like node and ts-node are kind of struggling with this
   -  GH comment that worked for me: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1062#issuecomment-1028139483
   -  Except `APP_ENV=dev node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --loader ts-node/esm src/fastifyServer.ts` because I need APP_ENV
      -  Tried `ts-node --esm` which someone else on the GH thread suggested, but it `cannot find module .../src/fastifyApp` even though I'm looking at it right beside
      -  Tried without the `--experimental*`, but gets the same error as trying to run with `ts-node --esm`
      -  I'm also seeing issues with compiled output not wanting to run (problems importing modules that are visible in `./dist`)
   -  This seems to be an ssue that causes many people pain and needs to be better explained/resolved or simplified
-  Add `fastify:dev` script to `package.json`

I think a lot of this comes down to the transition from CJS to ESM modules and the current challenges that has.

So, let's fire up Insomnia and create a test request to send.

```json
{
	"apiVersion": "2022-05-22",
	"backupJobId": "993aca31-453c-4c6c-878a-82551e2310a1",
	"dataDate": "2022-05-30",
	"backupDataLocation": "data-location"
}
```

It's saying route not found

-  Route was named `backup-request` when my prefered pattern is `backup-requests` (plural)
-  Fixed in Fastify and Express versions
-  Now it responds as expected and I see a row in the database
-  Server output shows the BackupRequestCreated event was created, but I don't see evidence the check allowed use case ran
   -  Look into that tomorrow

**COMMIT: FEAT: build Fastify server that can accept requests and update the database**

## Understanding the module problem

I spent some time reading about the issues I ran into last night, looking beyond the normal sources (including reading node docs on the module resolution algorithm).

-  The problem is due to the current state of node's support for ESM
   -  The node team has been working on ESM support for at least a couple of years now, so resolution may take a while.
-  If `"type": "module"` -> ESM, you can use top level `import` and `await`, but must include `.js` extensions on all imports from a relative path
-  If no `"type": "module"` -> CJS, no `.js` extension required, but no top level `import` or `await`
   -  One post had notes on VSCode settings that would do that automatically and a search/replace RegEx that would fix existing files
-  The node team seems to be working on improving the situation (so maybe ESM won't require)
-  Current TypeScript guidance leans toward running node in CJS style

Based on what I'm seeing, I have two options

-  Run node in ESM mode and use the `--experimental*` option
   -  If I think about running a production application, using an experimental feature
   -  The node docs say the option is likely to go away when they resolve ESM
   -  This option works now, but feels like a less good answer overall
-  Run node in ESM mode and add `.js` extensions to everything
   -  How does `.js` affect ts-node
   -  When node solves ESM, I'd want to strip the `.js` extensions
   -  Adding `.js` to refer to `.ts` feels counterintuitive
-  Run node in CJS mode and add a thin layer over the current top level
   -  Change `fastifyServer.ts` to export a function that starts the server; can `import`, `await`, etc.
   -  Add `fastifyIndex.ts` that uses `require()` to import the startup function and runs it.

I'm going to create a small test project to experiment. I'll confirm I can replicate the issue and document how different options work here.

### Test project (not included here)

-  `npm init` the project; `npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node`; `npm install chalk@4`
   -  chalk 4 is a CJS module and is a simple thing to import and use
-  Get the node 18 strictest config from GitHub (typescript bases)
   -  Add `"outDir": "./dist"`, `"includes": ["./src/**/*.ts"]`, `"excludes": ["./node_modules", "./dist"]`
-  Write a simple test program

```typescript
// src/hello.ts
import chalk from 'chalk';

export const sayHello = () => {
	console.log(chalk.red('Hello world!'));
};

// src/index.ts
import { sayHello } from './hello';

sayHello();
```

-  `npx ts-node src/index.ts` -- runs okay
-  `npx tsc` and `node dist/index.ts` -- runs okay

-  Change `tsconfig.json` -> `"module": "nodeNext", "moduleResolution": "nodeNext"`

   -  `ts-node` and `tsc ; node` work

-  Change `package.json` -> add `"type": "module"`

   -  `ts-node` reports unknown module on `index.ts`
   -  `tsc` reports "need js"

-  Change `index.ts`

   -  Add `.js` extension
   -  `ts-node` reports unknown module on `index.ts`; `npx ts-node src/index.js` gets a Node "module not found"
   -  `tsc ; node` works

-  Revert `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` to original

   -  `tsconfig.json` -> `"module": "commonJS", "moduleResolution": "node"`
   -  `package.json` -> remove `"type": "module"`
   -  `ts-node` fails because `hello.js`
   -  Remove `.js` -> `ts-node` works
   -  `tsc ; node` works

-  Change `hello` to be `async`, call with `await`
   -        VS Code tells me it won't work (top level await not allowed)
   -  `ts-node` fails because top level `await`; `tsc` fails because top level `await`
   -  Remove `await` in `index.ts` -> `ts-node` works, `tsc ; node` works
      -  But if `sayHello()` did an async call that returned something I needed (like connecting to a database, etc.), I'd need to wrap the setup in a wrapper function and call that wrapper in `index.ts` without `await` to ensure it runs
   -  BUT, I can `import`, which is good to know

DECISION:

-  `tsconfig.json` -> `"module": "commonJS", "moduleResolution": "node"`
-  `package.json` -> NO `"type": "module"`
-  Write the server startup in a function; call the function
-  Works with `ts-node`
-  `tsc ; node` complains because I'm importing `fastifyApp` as `../src/fastifyApp` (part of trying to hack it last night)
   -  Importing `./fastifyApp`
   -  `tsc ; node` works now
-  Change `fastify:dev` script to remove `experimental*` option
   -  Works

Problems solved for now! (Yay!!!!)

## Fix events not triggering next use case

I bet I'm not setting up my subscriptions right.
