# More tests, more code

## Notes

I want to prove the adapter can fast fail if the CB is open. That's more an adapter test, but it's valuable to demonstrate how to do it.

-  Same as first test except make a second call and check that result.
-  Comment out code in adapter to see test fail

I want to prove the circuit breaker can move from open to half open.

-  Added `isAlive()` to `'TestService`; `setLiveness()` lets me control the result during the test
-  Changed tests to create service first so CB can use `service.isAlive()`
-  Test written and fails because state doesn't change to half open--good.

I want to prove the circuit breaker can move from half open to closed after it reaches the success threshold.

-  Added `setTestResult()` to the service so I can change its result; replaced `isAliveTrue/False` functions

**COMMIT: FEAT: add state changes from open to half open to closed based on settings**
