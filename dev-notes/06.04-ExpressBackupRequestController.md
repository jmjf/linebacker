# Build an Express controller for CreateBackupRequest

I want to build a controller that uses Express instead of Fastify because I want to demonstrate the ability to swap HTTP server frameworks without rewriting the whole application.

## Notes

Stemmler uses Express.

-  `req: express.Request`
-  `res: express.Response`
-  `dto = req.body`
-  Should be a lot like the Fastify controller otherwise
-  Use a similar pattern for separating `app` from the server startup
-  Use a similar pattern for routes

But, Express doesn't have Fastify's built-in `inject()` for testing, so use Supertest, specifically `request` from supertest instead.

```typescript
	const res = await request(app)
		.post(url)
		.set('headerName', headerValue);  // repeat as needed
		.send(body);
```

## Development notes

-  Confirm Express is installed
-  Start with a copy of the Fastify controller
-  Need to write a base `ExpressController`
   -  Copy `FastifyController`
   -  Rename `reply` to `response` and `reply` method prefixes `respond` to align with Express language
   -  Use `Request` and `Response` types from Express
   -  Express mutates response, like Fastify, so code looks similar
-  Similar changes in the Express version of the controller
   -  All the places I used Fastify's partial setup, need to call `respond*` functions

Now let's convert the tests

-  Rename `app.ts` to `fastifyApp.ts`; change imports in Fastify controller tests
-  Write `src/backup-request/infrastructure/http/expressRoutes.ts` based on `fastifyRoutes.ts`
   -  Changes from `fastify` to `express` and `reply` to `response` and that's most of it
-  Create `expressApp.ts` as a copy of `fastifyApp.ts`
-  Express doesn't let me `inject()`, so I'll use Supertest
   -  `npm install --save-dev supertest @types/supertest`
   -  import request from supertest
   -  use it to post for the first test; comment out the others for now
   -  test is running, but it expects 400 and gets 200
   -  body is undefined; because I need to tell Express to use a body parsing middleware (`express.json()`)
      -  TODO add a check for this and a test and return a missing required data error
   -  also found I was trying to use `response.format()` when I wanted `response.type()` (derp)
   -  Now the test is complaining about parsing JSON, so I'm guessing I'm getting back an actual object instead of JSON
      -  Looking at the response, I want `text` not `body`
   -  The test passes!
-  Let's try the next test
   -  same issue with needing to parse text; I could get body here and not parse it
   -  problem, error message is the raw Prisma error
   -  digging into it, I made significant changes to how the DatabaseError cleanup works; need to change Fastify routes too
   -  It passes.

**COMMIT: 6.4.1 - FEAT: add Express controller; get first two tests working**

Based on eslint warnings, changed some `any` to `unknown` in the Express side and typed result when error handling.

-  Do similar in the Fastify side later (added to TODO md file).

Next test (400 error)

-  Now that I have the pattern down, it passes the first time
-  Commented the code that makes it pass and saw it fail as I expected it to fail, so call it good

Final test (good data)

-  Test passes first try
-  And it can fail

**COMMIT: 6.4.1 - TEST: convert remaining tests for Express controller**
