# Add CreateBackupRequestController

## Plan
* Rename `create-request` and `CreateRequest*.ts` to `create-backup-request` and `CreateBackupRequest*.ts`
* Can I write tests for the controller? Can they replace the tests for the use cases?
  * If can write tests, do so. Adjust tests as needed.
* Write the controller
* Replace controller in `zz-learn-fastify`

## Rename "create request" to "create backup request"

**Purpose:** Rename all "create request" to "create backup request"

**Why:** I'll need a way to track "create backup," "delete backup," and "restore backup" requests and their progress through the system. Name everything to be explicit about the type of request involved.

[x] Rename `create-request` to `create-backup-request`
[x] Rename `CreateRequest*.ts` to `CreateBackupRequest*.ts`
[x] Remove `apiVersion` from the DTO--the controller will map api versions to the DTO
[x] Ensure all references still work (walk through files)
[x] Ensure all tests run

**COMMIT: 4.2.1 - REFACTOR: create request -> create backup request**

## Write tests for the controller ???

I think I can. And those tests might be able to replace the unit tests for the use cases.

## Write the controller

## Replace controller in `zz-learn-fastify`
