# Build the retry service

Attributes

-  \_delayMs -- how long to wait between each retry
-  \_state -- allows stopping `runRetries`
-  \_retryEvents -- array of events to retry

Methods

-  get state -- returns \_state
-  set delayMs -- sets \_delayMs to a value passed
-  startRetries -- changes \_state to 'Started', allowing retries to run
-  stopRetries -- changes \_state to 'Halted', stopping any running retries
-  addRetry -- adds an event to the array if not already present (constructor names match and ids match)
-  runRetries -- loops through array and executes retries until array is empty or Halted
-  get retryEventIds -- returns an array of ids from the retry events
-  get retryEventCount -- returns the number of retries in the retry array

**COMMIT: FEAT: (incomplete) add RetryService; will test as part of circuit breaker**
