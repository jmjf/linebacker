# TODOs for return-to-bullmq

-  Can I write something like `test-events` for BullMQ?
-  Custom retry strategy

## DONE

-  [x] Queue names are hard coded in use cases (event knows the topic); move them to the event
-  [x] Currently, the event bus is specific to a module (backup request); make events know how to ser/de themselves
   -  Plan outlined in the Kafka branch, I think
-  [x] Can I make the worker app generic with some kind of parameter that controls what it creates and runs?
   -  BullMQ docs show an approach where a worker looks at data on the event and decides which methods to call
   -  This approach would work if I used a single queue (workers listen to one queue)
   -  Simplifies event publishing because there's no queue selection
   -  Workers can handle any event, so are less likely to idle
   -  Need to include event type information in the job so the worker can decide which consumer to call
-  [x] Add events, use cases, etc., for `Received` and `Allowed` events and hook them up
-  [x] Reorganize the event bus
   -  In `common/infrastructure`
   -  The event bus is exported from `eventBus` so a singleton instance is available
-  [x] Consider how to put `domainEvent` in `IEventBusEvent` and override locally; done in `eventBus`
-  [x] Add better data checks and tests in Receive use case to reduce risk of thrown errors if data is missing
   -  Receive requires a request id
   -  Added test
-  [x] Call publish in repo `save` events
   -  `save` must be able to recognize publish failed and return publish errors
-  [x] Use cases need to publish if status is status set by use case, otherwise create and save, which will publish
-  [x] Aggregates create events in the domain logic and add them to the aggregate's event array
-  [x] Add `publishEventsForAggregate` that loops over the aggregate's events and publishes them
   -  Ensure this works with methods on `AggregateRoot` so it is generic

**Ideas not used**

-  Should the queue adapter own all the queues and look them up?
   -  Might enable pausing, etc., if queue operations fail due to connect errors
   -  Could look up based on event name and avoid hardcoding name in events

**COMMIT: FEAT: add null/undefined check to ReceiveBackupRequestUseCase**
