# TODOs for return-to-bullmq

-  Add events, use cases, etc., for `Received` and `Allowed` and hook them up

   -  [x] Received
   -  [] Allowed

-  Reorganize the event bus (see notes below)
   -  Includes: Move event create into `AggregateRoot`
-  Start move to alternate configuration that will let you instantiate a single config object for all applications
   -  Supports configuration values below and idea that the event bus knows how to map events to queues
-  Configuration values for
   -  Queue settings are hard coded in `publish`; retry count should be large
   -  Custom backoff policy that increments to a max and then stays at that max
-  Add better data checks and tests in Receive use case to reduce risk of thrown errors if data is missing
-  Consider how to put `domainEvent` in `IEventBusEvent` and override locally
-  Consider pausing workers when a dependency is down
   -  Worker needs to know which services it cares about and how to check availability
   -  Needs a simple way to keep track of service availability and update when it fails

## Thinking about how to organize everything

-  Think about how to organize

   -  Event bus is now more generic consider move to `infrastructure` or `common/adapters`
   -  Should the queue adapter own all the queues and look them up?
      -  Might enable pausing, etc., if queue operations fail due to connect errors
      -  Could look up based on event name and avoid hardcoding name in events

-  Define the event bus and make it module that exports the event bus
   -  This approach ensures there is only one event bus object in the application
   -  Event bus users don't need to pass the event bus to constructors, just import it
-  Call publish in repo `save` events
   -  `save` must be able to recognize publish failed and return publish errors
-  Aggregates create events in the domain logic and add them to the aggregate's event array
-  Add `publishEventsForAggregate` that loops over the aggregate's events and publishes them
   -  Ensure this works with methods on `AggregateRoot` so it is generic
-  See also notes in 019.3 planning section

## DONE

-  [x] Queue names are hard coded in use cases (event knows the topic); move them to the event
-  [x] Currently, the event bus is specific to a module (backup request); make events know how to ser/de themselves
   -  Plan outlined in the Kafka branch, I think
-  [x] Can I make the worker app generic with some kind of parameter that controls what it creates and runs?
   -  BullMQ docs show an approach where a worker looks at data on the event and decides which methods to call
   -  This approach would work if I used a single queue (workers listen to one queue)
   -  Simplifies event publishing because there's no queue selection
   -  Workers can handle any event, so are less likely to idle
   -  Need to include event type information in the job so the worker can decide which consumer to call
