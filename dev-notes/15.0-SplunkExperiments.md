# Experimenting with Splunk logging

I want to know how to get logs from pino into Splunk.

## Plan

-  Get it running in docker
-  Import a file from stdout for a short test run of linebacker
-  See what I get
-  Figure out how to get linebacker stdout into Splunk directly

## Setup

Use the Splunk Docker container image. https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk/

Add Splunk to `dev-ms.yml`. Reference: https://github.com/dennybritz/docker-splunk/tree/master/enterprise. Also docker image page.

## Generate test log

Change `pinologger` to be generic. I can `| npx pino-pretty` to get pretty prints if needed.

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: pinologger always outputs to console; pipe to pino-pretty if needed**
