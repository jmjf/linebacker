# Error types
Add error types and expand `Response` left options to include them for all domain entities/aggregates.

I want to return an error object with a message and an optional object containing data about the error.

Looking more closely at Stemmler's `Guard` behavior, I see a need to make some changes to be more like his definition.

## Make Either clearer
[x] Rename types on `Either` to make them easier to read. L -> LeftType; R -> RightType

**COMMIT: 3.1.7.1 - REFACTOR: Rename types on Either to be clearer**

## Enhance Guard
[] Define `GuardResponse` type (string)
[] Return `Result<GuardResponse>` from guards
[] Refactor code to work with changes

I'm debating whether string is the right type, but I'm not sure why it wouldn't be (yet), so I'll go with it for now.

**COMMIT: 3.1.7.? - REFACTOR: Guard responses and code that uses them**

## Define base Error classes
What needs to go into these classes?

I want to include a result code of some kind to better support analysis. Would that be in errors or in `Result`?
* If in `Result` does it have any value for anything that isn't a failure?
  * Probably not. So could be defined for the base error and returned in the error value.
* Are error messages the same for every instance of the same error?
  * Yes, if errors are properly specific, so make them specific.
* How do I want to group errors?
  * Stemmler does it by use case (he generates all errors from use cases; failures in entities are `Result`s).
  * Some errors seem to apply to several use case--backup request not found, for example.
  * It would be useful to know what is causing the error (check allowed? send? reply?)
