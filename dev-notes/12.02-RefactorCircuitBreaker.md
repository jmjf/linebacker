# Refactor circuit breaker to use DelayedEventRunner

-  Rename all private variables to begin with `_`
-  Add `get events()` to `DelayedEventRunner` to get a copy of `_events` for circuit breaker status
-  Add private variable for `DelayedEventRunner`
-  Adjust code to use
-  Most existing functions remain and act as adapters for `DelayedEventRunner` functions with a check for Halted state

All tests are passing with no changes to tests, so I'm calling it likely good.

I want to test it with one version of the application to prove it.

-  When the queue is available, it works, but when the queue fails, it doesn't retry
-  It's working now, though I'm not sure what I changed to make that happen
   -  Added `console.log`s
   -  Changed direct state set in DER `runEvents` to use `setStateRun` method
   -  But the latter shouldn't be the issue
-  If the CB gets a failure, then a later call moves to HalfOpen, it looks like the second call's event is still ending up on the DER even though it ran before

Things I'm seeing

-  When the subscriber gets a new event and the connection is down, it doesn't add a retry for it, but the event ends up in the event array
   -  So, something besides the subscriber is calling `addRetryEvent`
   -  And the subscriber should be responsible for that call
   -  No, it adds if the connection check fails, just isn't logging, so I missed it
-  Based on output, the connection check adds the event when successful, which suggests something is wrong there
   -  When I turn the queue back on, the connection check seems to fail on first call, so the subscriber adds the event AND DOES NOT RUN IT
   -  The flow is stopping after the "Created" event; then DER runs the events so they get processed, so nothing is lost and ABISA isn't getting duplicate messages
   -  But I'm curious why the connection check fails the first time
      -  The first call to `isConnected()` after restarting the queue is returning false
      -  Is this due to CB state?
      -  Yes. `isConnected` is from CB, which is based on CB state
   -  Thinking about it a bit more, this is expected behavior if all circuit breaker users are failing fast
      -  The only way an adapter method can get to the `onSuccess` call is if the circuit breaker `isConnected` check succeeds (based on state) or the adapter doesn't check the circuit breaker before calling the service
      -  The point of the circuit breaker is to fail fast and not hammer the service when it's down
      -  So it makes sense that, until the circuit breaker detects that the service is up based on it's timer-driven checks, it would return failure

Clean up logging added to track behavior.

Also changed `readLocalQueue` to `localQueue` and accepts command line parameters `read` or `clear` so I can read or clear the queue.

**COMMIT: TEST: run and see requests producing expected behavior**
