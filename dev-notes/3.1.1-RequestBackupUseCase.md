# Get request backup use case working

## First steps
[x] Create the base use case class in `common/application`

[x] Start request backup use case in `create-backup/create-request`
[x] Created a DTO the same place. 

I rethought my earlier idea and decided to put functionally related code together. Repos and mappers will still go in `adapter`. Entities and similar will still go in `domain`. But I'll create directories for each use case and put code that is related to only that use case (controller, DTO, use case, etc.) in the use case's directory.

[x] Write test for use case -- when executed, the result isRight() (write use case to fail)

Test fails.

[x] Change use case to return a right() and test passes.

**COMMIT: 3.1.1.2 - stub out use case and first test**

### Testing note
After some experiments in a separate directory, I can test TypeORM repositories as shown below. The trick is, I need to create a `jest.fn()` mock for every method I call. It may be easier to use `jest.mock()` and mock the whole `Repository` object in the test because I don't want it touching the database. But, `Repository` has some functions that don't use the database that may be worth keeping (???). Also, a fully mocked object might fail silently if the test doesn't mock a function the tested function calls. With this approach, the test will fail because necessary parts of the `Repository` are missing.

The main weakness with this approach is that it doesn't support `Repository.createQueryBuilder()`. The fallback for QueryBuilder support is to use a sqlite in memory database, which has to be created in the `.spec.ts` and used to create a TypeORM repository that is passed to the application repository. In that case, get the `DataSource` configuration from environment variables and select the appropriate `.env` file.

`entity/User.ts`
```ts
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
   @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
   id: number;
   @Column()
   firstName: string;
   @Column()
   lastName: string;
}
```

`testDb.ts`
```ts
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './entity/User';

// typeORM has a save overload that returns only one, but TS isn't recognizing it
export async function testDb(userRepository: Repository<User>, rawUser): Promise<User[]> {
   const user = userRepository.create(rawUser);
   const result = await userRepository.save(user);
   console.log(result);
   return result;
}
```

`testDb.spec.ts`
```ts
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './entity/User';
import { testDb } from './index';

test('testDb', async () => {
   const rawUser = {firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Jones'};
   const user = {id: 1, ...rawUser} as User;

   const userRepository = new Repository(User, null);
   userRepository.create = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(user);
   userRepository.save = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([user]);

   const result = await testDb(userRepository, rawUser);

   expect(userRepository.save).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
   expect(userRepository.create).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
   expect(result[0].id).toBe(1);
});
```

While this discussion is focused on TypeORM, I suspect it would work with sequelize and many other ORMs.
#### How to create a sqlite in memory data source for TypeORM
```typescript
import { DataSource } from "typeorm"
import { User } from "./entity/User"

export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "better-sqlite3",
    name: 'memory',
    database: ':memory:',
    synchronize: true,
    logging: false,
    entities: [User],  // or pass a list of directory paths like 'src/entity/*.ts'
    migrations: [],
    subscribers: [],
})
```
## Continuing with the use case
Should I build value objects for UUID, date string, and date/time string? If so, those go to `common` because they're application-wide.

[x] UUID - use `uuid.validate()` and `uuid.version()` to ensure the value is a V4 UUID

~~* date string - check that it is yyyy-mm-dd format and passes `Date.parse()` (doesn't return `NaN` test with `isNaN()`).~~

~~* date/time string - check that it passes `Date.parse()` and ends in Z (UTC) or contains a + or - (offset). (time zone must be specified)~~

### Build it
```
[x] Add remaining attributes to DTO.
[x] Build out the backup request entity for create and basic pieces, any value objects (`create-backup/domain`).
   [x] Add rest of the properties to the properties interface.
   [x] Make `create()` properly create the request.
      [x] check for null or undefined (add Guard)
      [x] define RequestStatusType, BackupProviderType, RequestTransportType
      [x] set up properties
      [x] call constructor
[x] Write the use case using the entity etc.
   [x] set up props to pass to create() based on DTO data
   [x] request status = received, received timestamp = now
   [x] create, store, return result
```

While doing the work above, I standardized language in Result and IGuardResult around forms of "success" and "failure" so the language is consistent. Consistency should reduce cognitive friction when working with these classes.
* Result.ok() -> Result.succeed() (vs. Result.fail())
* IGuardResult.ok -> IGuardResult.isSuccess

**COMMIT: 3.1.1.3 - build use case**

### Write tests for the use case
* Good data -> result with an id (result.backupRequestId)
  * ensure isChecked(), isSentToInterface(), isReplied() all return false
  * expect repo.save to be called once
* Errors
  * invalid transport type
  * null value for a required value (backupJobId)
  * undefined value for a required value (getOnStartFlag)
  * invalid dataDate
  * in all cases, expect repo.save to not be called

**COMMIT: 3.1.1.4 - build tests for use case**
