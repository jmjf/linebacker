# Get request backup use case working

## Create base use case
In `common/application`

## Start request backup use case
In `create-backup/application` (???)
Created a DTO (in `adapter`), stub repo (in `adapter`), and entity (in `domain`) because they're required to define the use case.

Write test for use case
* When executed, the result isRight() (write use case to fail)

Test fails. Change use case to return a right() and test passes.

**COMMIT: 3.1.1.2 - stub out use case and first test**

Build out the backup request entity, any value objects (`create-backup/domain`)

### Major steps for use case
* create domain value objects for data in the DTO -- verify they create (no errors)
  * I'm thinking I may want a value object class after all, but TBD how far I go
* request status = received
* confirmed, sent, completed timestamps => null
* maybe check request doesn't already exist (request id) -- error if it does ?????
  * How much am I willing to trust UUID to be unique enough?
  * Or will repo return an error if the request exists?
* set get on start flag based on value passed from controller
* return result
