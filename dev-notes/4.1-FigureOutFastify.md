# Figure out `fastify`


Controllers connect the application code to the web framework, so are affected by it. So, I want to have a basic understanding of the framework before working on them.

(My other choice would by `hapi`.)

## Plan A
Create `src/zz-learn-fastify` as a working directory to make it easy to remove later. (`zz` to put it at the bottom of `src` tree.)

Roughly align to clean architecture approach
* Handler logic "use case" functions (but no entities/aggregates)
* Route controller calls handler

Questions:
* How do I write an HTTP API in `fastify`
  * Get hello world working
  * Add an endpoint with a URL parameter
  * Add an endpoint with that takes a body
* How do I manage routes
  * Separate routes for test api
  * Look at how Stemmler organized his routes and use case calls and if it can align with `fastify`'s model.
* How do I use logging

## Hello world

Official documentation on using `fastify` with TypeScript is scant. The GitHub repo in the references gives an example of using types. Also `import { ... } from 'fastify';` gives a list of importable types if I start typing `Fastify` in the brackets, so can help figure out what's available.

I'll continue with it for now, but this may make me lean toward `hapi`, which has better TS documentation and seems to have a bit more support.

```typescript
import { FastifyRequest, FastifyReply, fastify } from 'fastify';

const server = fastify({
   logger: true
});

server.get('/', async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
   server.log.info('hello world');
   return { hello: 'world' };
});

const start = async() => {
   try {
      server.log.info('starting server on port 3000');
      await server.listen(3000);
   } catch (err) {
      server.log.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
   }
};

start();
```

Okay. That works.

**COMMIT: 4.1.1 - ADD: hello world in fastify**
