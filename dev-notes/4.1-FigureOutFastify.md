# Figure out `fastify`


Controllers connect the application code to the web framework, so are affected by it. So, I want to have a basic understanding of the framework before working on them.

(My other choice would by `hapi`.)

## Plan A
Create `src/zz-learn-fastify` as a working directory to make it easy to remove later. (`zz` to put it at the bottom of `src` tree.)

Roughly align to clean architecture approach
* Handler logic "use case" functions (but no entities/aggregates)
* Route controller calls handler

Questions:
* How do I write an HTTP API in `fastify`
  * Get hello world working
  * Add an endpoint with a URL parameter
  * Add an endpoint with that takes a body
* How do I manage routes
  * Separate routes for test api
  * Look at how Stemmler organized his routes and use case calls and if it can align with `fastify`'s model.
* How do I use logging

## How do I write an HTTP API in `fastify`?

### Get hello world working
References

Official documentation on using `fastify` with TypeScript is scant. The GitHub repo in the references gives an example of using types. Also `import { ... } from 'fastify';` gives a list of importable types if I start typing `Fastify` in the brackets, so can help figure out what's available.

I'll continue with it for now, but this may make me lean toward `hapi`, which has better TS documentation and seems to have a bit more support.

```typescript
import { FastifyRequest, FastifyReply, fastify } from 'fastify';

const server = fastify({
   logger: true
});

server.get('/', async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
   server.log.info('hello world');
   return { hello: 'world' };
});

const start = async() => {
   try {
      server.log.info('starting server on port 3000');
      await server.listen(3000);
   } catch (err) {
      server.log.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
   }
};

start();
```

Okay. That works.

**COMMIT: 4.1.1 - ADD: hello world in fastify**

### Move routes into a separate module
Based on references and VS Code hints, I end up with

```typescript
// routes.ts
import { FastifyInstance, FastifyPluginOptions, FastifyReply, FastifyRequest } from 'fastify';

export async function routes(server: FastifyInstance, options: FastifyPluginOptions) {
   server.log.info(`called routes with options ${JSON.stringify(options)}`);
   server.get('/', async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
      server.log.info('hello world');
      return { hello: 'world' };
   });
}
```

```typescript
// index.ts
import { fastify } from 'fastify';
import { routes } from './routes';

const server = fastify({
   logger: true
});

server.register(routes);

server.log.info('starting server on port 3000');
server.listen(3000, (err, address) => {
   if (err) {
      server.log.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
   }
});
```

Interesting issue here. The `server.listen()` call matches a signature VS Code reports `(port: number | string, (err: Error, address: string): void => void)`, but when I compile, I get an error that the compiler can't find the signature. Not sure what's going on there, but I'm leaving it untyped for now.

I can use `address: string` and it compiles, but `err: Error` fails (with or without type on `address`). The `address` parameter seems to be optional.

Ah, the compiler error says `err: Error | null`. Using that type works. So the signature in VS Code is missing information.

So, it works now.

**COMMIT: 4.1.2 - REFACTOR: Routes in a separate module**

### Add an endpoint with a URL parameter
Let's make a `square` endpoint that takes a number as a URL parameter.
Return a JSON object like `{ param: number, square: number }`.
