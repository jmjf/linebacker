# Startup recovery use case

## What is it about?

Key points from 12.0 below. See 12.0 for full details.

-  The use case

   -  gets all allowed request ids that were allowed before the event was created (pass event timestamp)
   -  gets all received request ids that were received before the event was created
   -  add events for retry to a retry service
   -  start retries
   -  return results

-  Build use case (test plan TBD at start of this part)
   -  Requires methods on repo--`getAllowedRequestIdsBefore` and `getReceivedRequestIdsBefore`
   -  Each method selects requests for the specified state before a timestamp
   -  Use a custom mapTo function to returns an array of request id values (strings) to return to the use case

## Other considerations

How will I run this use case?

By publishing an event that announces the application started and when.

Each `initModule` registers a subscriber for the startup event. That subscriber runs this use case. If I limit selected data based on when the startup happens, I may be able to split the use case for different statuses or make a generic use case that publishes different events based on the DTO for `execute`.

The event needs to be published after the `initModule`s run by `addRoutes`. I'm leaning toward publishing the event in the server after calling `buildApp` for two reasons: the server can get the start timestamp for request cutoff; putting it in `buildApp` requires mocking database results for startup recovery in controller tests, complicating testing.

## What does it need

-  `IBackupRequestRepo` with method `getRequestIdsByStatus`
-  method takes a required `backupRequestStatus` and an optional `beforeTimestamp` to limit data pulled
-  Needs to know which events to run for each status; reasonable given where it lives

`getRequestIdsByStatus` gets data and always returns an array (empty, one element, many elements)

-  Map data TypeORM returns to get id strings only
-  Does TypeORM returns an array for a single result; may need to handle single vs. array in mapping

## What does it do

-  Get allowed request ids that were allowed before the event was created (pass event timestamp)
-  Get received request ids that were received before the event was created
-  Add events to a `DelayedEventRunner`
   -  For allowed requests, `BackupRequestAllowed`
   -  For received requests, `BackupRequestCreated`
   -  Can put all the events on a single DER; configure in the use case
-  If at least one request needing recovery, start running events; do not wait for completion
   -  Do not run if no requests
-  Return count of each request status set up for retry
   -  Subscriber will log
   -  Result of Results

This use case is unusual because it returns a Result of Results and is always `ok`.

```typescript
return ok({
	allowedResult, // result from db call for allowed
	receivedResult, // result from db call for received
});
```

The subscriber will check each result and log appropriately.

## How can it succeed; how can it fail

-  Get allowed request ids that were allowed before the event was created (pass event timestamp)
   -  Succeed: (`isOk`) copy `result.value` to `allowedRequestIds` array
   -  Fail: will handle at return time; do not stop the use case; let `allowedRequestIds` be empty
-  Get received request ids that were received before the event was created
   -  Succeed: (`isOk`) copy `result.value` to `receivedRequestIds` array
   -  Fail: will handle at return time; do not stop the use case; let `receivedRequestIds` be empty
-  Add events to a `DelayedEventRunner`
   -  Can't fail
-  If at least one request needing recovery, start running events (background, no `await`)
   -  Can't fail
-  Return count of each request status set up for retry
   -  Can't fail

How to set up tests

-  mock database results for allowed and received
   -  [allowed | received] gets [DatabaseError | NotFoundError | results]
-  run use case
-  expect
   -  use case result is always ok; need to look at individual results
   -  both good -> each result `isOk`; expected length
   -  any err -> expect err type
-  test for single and 2 result values
   -  can set up singles using one element from the "good result" array of 2 values

## Notes

-  `RestartStalledRequestsUseCase`
-  Stubbed out use case; instead of returning a `Result`, it returns an object with two `Result`s
-  TypeORM find returns an array always; may be an empty array if not found
-  I'm writing all the test up front because the use case has only one return
-  I'm simplifying the tests
   -  Testing for errors in allowed or received only while the other gets results (no both error, covered by these tests)
   -  Testing ok with two result values not one because TypeORM always returns an array and the result will always contain an array
   -  Returning an array of events on isOk instead of an array of ids; can get ids from events
-  Tests were failing; traced to `BackupRequestCreated` event using `backupRequest.backupRequestId` instead of `backupRequest.id`
   -  Changed to use the `id` property to be consistent with other `BackupRequestAllowed` and align with more generic event structure as a goal
   -  Failure was caused by the fact that I was faking the `BackupRequest` the events expect
   -  Added TODO to look at changing events to get a `UniqueIdentifier` instead of an `AggregateRoot`
