# Pino transport to move data to Splunk

-  Build a pino splunk transport using `pino-abstract-transport` and Splunk's JS libraries and the [`SplunkLogger`](https://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/JSlogging/0.11.1/splunk-javascript-logging-docs/SplunkLogger.html) they provide
-  The `SplunkLogger.send()` method takes a message, severity, and metadata
   -  Metadata mapping: host -> host; name -> source
   -  Event -> pino object minus host, name, time (???)
   -  Time -> pino object time.valueOf()/1000
-  Also see [examples](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-javascript-logging/tree/master/examples)
   -  Auto-batching is probably wise if batch slices are kept small enough

## Setup

`npm install pino-abstract-transport splunk-logging`
`npm install --save-dev @types/splunk-logging`

## Build it

Start with the example for console logging from https://github.com/pinojs/pino-abstract-transport.

Build a `logToSplunk` method to replace `console.log()` using examples from `splunk-logging`.

Looking at the Splunk code, it gets `time` from `metadata`, but that isn't defined in the types, so can't type the payload with a defined type. See `_initializeMetadata` (accepts `time`) and `_makeBody` (formats time, note that `body.time` here is from `metadata`).

## Try it

Configure a HEC, `linebacker-pino-01` that sends to `linebacker-pino-01` index with type `_json`. Add token as default for the transport (for now). Search index and see empty.

Start backend components. `npm run express:dev:typeorm | npx ts-node src/infrastructure/logging/pinoSplunkTransport.ts`.

Does not seem to be working. Added some `console.log()`s and they aren't being called, so it doesn't seem to be working.

Let's try the example abstract transport. It isn't pipeable either. Looks like `pino-pretty` does things differently (transform stream described in pino transport docs, not in `pino-abstract-transport` docs), so let's try that.

After some digging, I need some stuff from `pino-pretty`'s `bin.js` -> `pstBin.ts`. A quick test with the call to log to Splunk disabled outputs to the console as expected. Time for the real test.

Well, it logged to Splunk (yay!) but the log result isn't what I want.

-  Not honoring `time`
-  The log content I care about is in `event.message` and isn't searchable
-  So, I need to drop `splunk-logging`, build the event myself
   -  Reading through the `splunk-logging` code, it looks like it doesn't play nice with what my testing showed works
   -  It makes some assumptions that don't agree with what I see happening in the real data
   -  And what it sends for message is stringified JSON that isn't parsed in Splunk for some reason
   -  I'm guessing it may require specific configuration to in splunk to work
   -  So, I need to write my own caller to send data to Splunk's URL like I'm doing with Insomnia
   -  But, some of the concepts in the logger, like the queue manager, are worth basing on

So, I have a working transport, but I need to change how it sends data to Splunk.

**COMMIT: FEAT: build transport for Splunk data; gets data to Splunk, but isn't usable**
