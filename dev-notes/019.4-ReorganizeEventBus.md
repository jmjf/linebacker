# Reorganize the event bus code

## Planning based on notes in 19.99

The event bus is generic, so move it into `infrastructure` or `common/infrastructure`.

Testing shows I can make the event bus a singleton and still mock it's behavior in tests, so:

Define the event bus and make it a module that exports the event bus instance

-  This approach ensures there is only one event bus object in the application
-  Event bus users don't need to pass the event bus to constructors, just import it

I want aggregates to create events and publish to take a set of events from the aggregate.

-  Needs to work with methods on `AggregateRoot` so it's generic
   -  I want to be able to swap between old event bus approach and BullMq or others
   -  `AggregateRoot` doesn't care about the event bus, it just builds and stores an array of events (remove the concept of marking aggregates for publish)
   -  Repo `save()` passes the events from the aggregate to the event bus it knows

I want the event bus to publish on save. If `publish()` fails, `save()` should return an `EventBusError`.

-  Add the correct errors to `save()` response.
-  Use cases only publish in a recovery situation
   -  If the data is in a status the use case would set, `publish()`
   -  If the data is in the preceding status, `create()` and `save()`
-  This approach should be reasonably safe because:
   -  BullMq identifies jobs by id
   -  BullMq ignores an attempt to add a job id that already exists in a queue, including completed/failed jobs
   -  Configuring the queue correctly should ensure that use case failures don't result in duplicate jobs
   -  When adding jobs, pass option `jobId` with value event type + event key
   -  Configuration includes ensuring completed/failed jobs are kept for much longer than `stalledInterval`
      -  Worker `stalledInterval` defaults to 30 seconds; 90 seconds is probably a large value
      -  Keeping completed/failed jobs for 15-30 minutes is probably reasonable

## Does jest.mock() in a test mock the module in a singleton?

-  Add a line to `BmqEventBus` to export an instance
-  Write a simple test to prove it works or doesn't

In `BmqEventBus.ts`, added

```typescript
export const bmqBus = new BmqEventBus(bullMq, bullMqConnection);
```

Wrote test `BmqInstance.spec.ts`

```typescript
// jest.mock('bullmq');
import * as bullMq from 'bullmq';
import { IEventBusEvent } from '../../../infrastructure/event-bus/IEventBus';
import { BackupRequestAccepted } from '../../domain/BackupRequestAccepted.event';
// const mockBullMq = jest.mocked(bullMq);

import { bmqBus } from './BmqEventBus';

describe('BmqInstance', () => {
	beforeEach(() => {
		// mockBullMq.Queue.mockClear();
	});

	const testEvent = {
		topicName: 'topic',
		key: 'key',
		eventData: {
			data: 'this is a test',
		},
	};

	test('basic test', async () => {
		// mockBullMq.Queue.prototype.add.mockResolvedValue({} as bullMq.Job);
		const publishSpy = jest.spyOn(bmqBus, 'publish');
		const testEvent = {
			topicName: 'topic',
			key: 'key',
			eventData: {
				data: 'this is a test',
			},
		};

		const result = await bmqBus.publish(testEvent as unknown as IEventBusEvent);

		console.log('result', result);

		expect(result.isOk()).toBe(true);
	});
});
```

When I run the test as shown, I get ECONNREFUSED errors. If I uncomment the commented lines, the test passes, and the output value is the event passed.

**Conclusion: I can use the event bus as a singleton and still test with it if I mock it in tests.**

## Event bus interface

What does the event bus interface look like? What do I really need?

-  Old event bus
   -  `publishEventsForAggregate` (publishes all events on the aggregate)
      -  calls `publishToSubscribers for each event, then clear's the aggregate's events
   -  `publishToSubscribers` (publishes a single event to any subscribers)
   -  `subscribe` (old event bus does it all)
-  BullMq event bus
   -  `publishEventsForAggregate` (same)
   -  `publish` (publishes a single event to the Redis store)

```typescript
interface IEventBus {
	publishEventsBulk(events: IEventBusEvent[]): Promise<Result<IEventBusEvent[], AdapterErrors.EventBusError>>;
	publishEvent(event: IEventBusEvent): Promise<Result<IEventBusEvent, AdapterErrors.EventBusError>>;
	subscribe(eventName: string, handler: (event: IEventBusEvent) => void): Promise<void>;
}
```

I'll make the `subscribe()` method do nothing for the BullMq event bus because it doesn't use it. I don't need a Promise yet, but plan for possible alternatives in the future need it.

Handlers will be different for different event bus implementations. Old event bus handlers need to register so the event bus can call them. For BullMq, the worker subscribes to the queue and dispatches events to handlers based on event type.

## Work notes

-  Moved `IEventBus.ts` into `common/infrastructure/event-bus`
   -  Includes `IEventBusEvent` and `IEventBusEventData`
   -  Added `IEventBus` (interface above)
-  Moved `EventBusError` to `InfrastructureErrors`
-  Defined `event: unknown` as a member of `IEventBusEventData`; made specific with a defined type in each event
-  Changed consumer to include `eventType` in logs, use `event` instead of `domainEvent`
-  Changed `BmqEventBus` `publish()` to set `jobId`
-  Moved `BmqEventBus` and `BmqConsumer` to `common/infrastructure/event-bus` and renamed `Bullmq*`
-  Renamed `*.event.ts` to `*.bullmq.ts` because they're BullMq specific
-  Renamed old event bus events to `*.deb.ts`
-  Changes to unit tests to address changes to mocking behavior
   -  event bus spies are tied to global, so define in outer describe and `mockClear` in `beforeEach`
   -  renames for clarity or more general (not BullMq specific) names
   -  other adjustments as necessary for changes above

Unit tests are passing.

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: define event bus interface and change BullMq event bus to conform to it**

Add `publishEventsBulk` for BullMq bus

-  Returns the first error or passed events if ok

**COMMIT: FEAT: add publishedEventsBulk for BullMq event bus**

NEXT STEPS:

-  Add `publishEventsBulk` for BullMq bus
-  Build a new version of old event bus that conforms to new interface
-  Change `AggregateRoot` event add behavior
-  Change repos to accept an event bus in the constructor and publish to it
