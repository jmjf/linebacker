# Reorganize the event bus code

## Planning based on notes in 19.99

The event bus is generic, so move it into `infrastructure` or `common/infrastructure`.

Testing shows I can make the event bus a singleton and still mock it's behavior in tests, so:

Define the event bus and make it a module that exports the event bus instance

-  This approach ensures there is only one event bus object in the application
-  Event bus users don't need to pass the event bus to constructors, just import it

I want aggregates to create events and publish to take a set of events from the aggregate.

-  Needs to work with methods on `AggregateRoot` so it's generic
   -  I want to be able to swap between old event bus approach and BullMq or others
   -  `AggregateRoot` doesn't care about the event bus, it just builds and stores an array of events (remove the concept of marking aggregates for publish)
   -  Repo `save()` passes the events from the aggregate to the event bus it knows

I want the event bus to publish on save. If `publish()` fails, `save()` should return an `EventBusError`.

-  Add the correct errors to `save()` response.
-  Use cases only publish in a recovery situation
   -  If the data is in a status the use case would set, `publish()`
   -  If the data is in the preceding status, `create()` and `save()`
-  This approach should be reasonably safe because:
   -  BullMq identifies jobs by id
   -  BullMq ignores an attempt to add a job id that already exists in a queue, including completed/failed jobs
   -  Configuring the queue correctly should ensure that use case failures don't result in duplicate jobs
   -  When adding jobs, pass option `jobId` with value event type + event key
   -  Configuration includes ensuring completed/failed jobs are kept for much longer than `stalledInterval`
      -  Worker `stalledInterval` defaults to 30 seconds; 90 seconds is probably a large value
      -  Keeping completed/failed jobs for 15-30 minutes is probably reasonable

## Does jest.mock() in a test mock the module in a singleton?

-  Add a line to `BmqEventBus` to export an instance
-  Write a simple test to prove it works or doesn't

In `BmqEventBus.ts`, added

```typescript
export const bmqBus = new BmqEventBus(bullMq, bullMqConnection);
```

Wrote test `BmqInstance.spec.ts`

```typescript
// jest.mock('bullmq');
import * as bullMq from 'bullmq';
import { IEventBusEvent } from '../../../infrastructure/event-bus/IEventBus';
import { BackupRequestAccepted } from '../../domain/BackupRequestAccepted.event';
// const mockBullMq = jest.mocked(bullMq);

import { bmqBus } from './BmqEventBus';

describe('BmqInstance', () => {
	beforeEach(() => {
		// mockBullMq.Queue.mockClear();
	});

	const testEvent = {
		topicName: 'topic',
		key: 'key',
		eventData: {
			data: 'this is a test',
		},
	};

	test('basic test', async () => {
		// mockBullMq.Queue.prototype.add.mockResolvedValue({} as bullMq.Job);
		const publishSpy = jest.spyOn(bmqBus, 'publish');
		const testEvent = {
			topicName: 'topic',
			key: 'key',
			eventData: {
				data: 'this is a test',
			},
		};

		const result = await bmqBus.publish(testEvent as unknown as IEventBusEvent);

		console.log('result', result);

		expect(result.isOk()).toBe(true);
	});
});
```

When I run the test as shown, I get ECONNREFUSED errors. If I uncomment the commented lines, the test passes, and the output value is the event passed.

**Conclusion: I can use the event bus as a singleton and still test with it if I mock it in tests.**

## Event bus interface

What does the event bus interface look like? What do I really need?

-  Old event bus
   -  `publishEventsForAggregate` (publishes all events on the aggregate)
      -  calls `publishToSubscribers for each event, then clear's the aggregate's events
   -  `publishToSubscribers` (publishes a single event to any subscribers)
   -  `subscribe` (old event bus does it all)
-  BullMq event bus
   -  `publishEventsForAggregate` (same)
   -  `publish` (publishes a single event to the Redis store)

```typescript
interface IEventBus {
	publishEventsBulk(events: IEventBusEvent[]): Promise<Result<IEventBusEvent[], AdapterErrors.EventBusError>>;
	publishEvent(event: IEventBusEvent): Promise<Result<IEventBusEvent, AdapterErrors.EventBusError>>;
	subscribe(eventName: string, handler: (event: IEventBusEvent) => void): Promise<void>;
}
```

I'll make the `subscribe()` method do nothing for the BullMq event bus because it doesn't use it. I don't need a Promise yet, but plan for possible alternatives in the future need it.

Handlers will be different for different event bus implementations. Old event bus handlers need to register so the event bus can call them. For BullMq, the worker subscribes to the queue and dispatches events to handlers based on event type.

## Work notes

-  Moved `IEventBus.ts` into `common/infrastructure/event-bus`
   -  Includes `IEventBusEvent` and `IEventBusEventData`
   -  Added `IEventBus` (interface above)
-  Moved `EventBusError` to `InfrastructureErrors`
-  Defined `event: unknown` as a member of `IEventBusEventData`; made specific with a defined type in each event
-  Changed consumer to include `eventType` in logs, use `event` instead of `domainEvent`
-  Changed `BmqEventBus` `publish()` to set `jobId`
-  Moved `BmqEventBus` and `BmqConsumer` to `common/infrastructure/event-bus` and renamed `Bullmq*`
-  Renamed `*.event.ts` to `*.bullmq.ts` because they're BullMq specific
-  Renamed old event bus events to `*.deb.ts`
-  Changes to unit tests to address changes to mocking behavior
   -  event bus spies are tied to global, so define in outer describe and `mockClear` in `beforeEach`
   -  renames for clarity or more general (not BullMq specific) names
   -  other adjustments as necessary for changes above

Unit tests are passing.

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: define event bus interface and change BullMq event bus to conform to it**

Add `publishEventsBulk` for BullMq bus

-  Returns the first error or passed events if ok

**COMMIT: FEAT: add publishedEventsBulk for BullMq event bus**

-  Write `MemoryEventBus`
   -  Use a `Map` instead of a dictionary object; makes life easier
-  `AggregateRoot` changes
   -  Change type of event array; rename to `_events`
   -  Use `IEventBusEvents` instead of `IDomainEvent`
   -  Change method names to `event` vs. `domainEvent` names
   -  Change log method with data based on new structure
-  `BackupRequest` changes
   -  Use new style events; change imports
   -  Add new style Created event
-  Repo changes
   -  Declare `eventBus` next to `IEventBus`; use an env variable to select type -- default to memory (bullmq or memory)
   -  Use `eventBus.publishEventsBulk` with the aggregate's `events` getter
-  Run tests and see what breaks
   -  Many import changes to move away from `DomainEventBus` related imports
   -  Changes to subscribers because event interface changed
   -  Added `clearHandlers` to event bus interface because it's needed for testing
   -  Added singleton to select event bus (bullmq or memory) based on environment variable (EVENT_BUS_TYPE -> memory or bullmq)
   -  Ensure all event bus users are importing from `eventBus` except BullMQ specific tests

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: (some tests failing) build memory event bus for new interface; change application to use new event bus interface**

-  `incrementRetryCount()`, `incremementConnectFailureCount()`, `get eventType()`
-  Change `IEventBusEvent` to `EventBusEvent`, an abstract class that implements the methods
   -  Descendant constructors need to set `_eventData` and `_eventKey`
   -  Avoids duplicating method code
-  Fix circuit breaker and DER tests
   -  Mostly changes to types due to event bus reorg

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: (some tests failing) event -> abstract class to avoid duplicating method code; get circuit breaker and DER tests passing**

## Resolving failing tests

In `check-request-allowed-use-case-2`, the tests are BullMq specific, but use `eventBus`, which defaults to memory.

-  Can I fix it by setting env value in the test to override default
   -  Helps, but failing now because publish is called twice
   -  Because we publish in `save` and the use case
-  Change use case to publish if allowed and check and save if received
-  Change `save` to await event bus publish result so it can return an error if publish fails

`ExpressAcceptBackupRequestController` -> Fixed by setting env value for bus type. Accept can't be used with memory bus because it could lose requests.

`ReceiveBackupRequestUseCase` -> Fixed by setting env value for bus type. Receive works with accept so can't be used with memory bus.

`AcceptBackupRequestUseCase` -> Fixed by setting env value for bus type. Accept can't be used with memory bus.

**COMMIT: TEST: fix issues in failing unit tests; all tests pass**

## Can I replace CreateBackupRequest with ReceiveBackupRequest

-  Create doesn't accept a request id, status or timestamp
-  Receive needs to check if request exists by id; check status if found (publish); etc.

It may be doable, but it seems questionable. The memory bus solution is temporary--the goal is to move to BullMq--so I won't take that time.

## Can I move the BullMq connection into eventBus

The main issue is that I still need a place to export the types I need. Or do I. I may not need a BullMq type. Where is it used

-  Looks like the main use is as a type to pass the BullMq instance into the init module
-  But I can import eventBus where it's needed and don't need to pass around BullMq instances
-  Except in the BullMq event bus, where I need the type only

I have a couple of tests failing in the receive use case

-  Receive gets a request id; calling `create` with a request id doesn't generate an event
-  So, receive needs to create the event before saving--maybe
-  The use case can't call `addDomainEvent` on the aggregate, with good reason (not something the use case should be worrying about)
-  The more consistent answer is to create the request based on the DTO then change status; change status creates the event
-  This approach means I need `acceptedTimestamp` separate from `receivedTimestamp`

Now tests are failing because I added `acceptedTimestamp`.

-  Need to add accepted timestamp wherever I define a `TypeormBackupRequest` in tests

`ExpressAcceptBackupRequestController` test is failing because it looks for `receivedTimestamp`, but now should look for `acceptedTimestamp`.

Change `BullmqConsumer` test to use `eventBus` instead of creating the event bus.

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: remove BullMqInfa and move into eventBus; fix tests**

## Run it and see it work

Drop and create tables because table structure changed.

### With memory event bus

-  Ensure env is set up for memory bus
-  Ensure api routes to Create
-  Start Azurite queue
-  Start api

In `publishApplicationResilienceReady`, `ApplicationResilienceReady` is failing because it's missing properties of an array.

-  Needs to call `publishEvent` instead of `publishEventsBulk`

Now it starts and submitting a request seems to work

-  Logs look correct
-  Data in database looks correct
-  Message is in Azurite queue

Stop api.

### With BullMq event bus

-  Ensure env is set up for BullMq bus
-  Start Redis and delete all keys
-  Confirm Azurite is still running
-  Delete and recreate the queue to delete all messages
-  Start api
-  Post request
   -  Returns successfully
   -  Event is in Redis
   -  No data added to database
-  Start worker
   -  Erroring because it doesn't know the event names
   -  `bmqWorker` is looking for `eventName` s/b `eventType`
   -  Add `ApplicationResilienceReady`, but skip (log only)
-  Start worker

Several issues:

-  It crashes when `BullmqConsumer` errors
-  It saves the Received request, but `AcceptedTimestamp` and `ReceivedTimestamp` are null; `SentToInterfaceTimestamp` is set
   -  `BackupRequestAccepted` event has `receivedTimestamp` where it should have `acceptedTimestamp`
   -  `BackupRequest.setStatusReceived()` is setting `sentToInterfaceTimestamp` where it should set `receivedTimestamp`
   -  `receivedTimestamp` is null; need to use `backupResult` instead of `createResult.value` because `backupResult` is where status is set

Retry crashes with a database error

-  `receivedTimestamp` is null
-  In the log, the event doesn't seem to show `acceptedTimestamp`
   -  `acceptedTimestamp` appears in the response to the API call; has a value in db params, but isn't the same as response
   -  Event on queue doesn't have `acceptedTimestamp`
   -  Needed to restart API; now I have `acceptedTimestamp` in the queue and db
   -  But the `acceptedTimestamp` in the db is after `receivedTimestamp; queue has correct for Accepted event
   -  Logging shows the values appear to be correct in the code up to `SendToInterface` call to `save`
   -  Let's make the worker only handle Accepted; in the database, it's wrong when the request is first saved
   -  Columns are mapped wrong in the TypeORM entity; that fixed the database issue
   -  Clean up logging and restore full event handling

So, we're down to the worker crashing instead of continuing.

-  Easy way to test this is to force a use case to error; set Received to error
-  Crashes, so the test setup is valid
-  `await`ing the handler solves the crashing issue; I'm guessing failing to await left it lost
-  Testing again after removing forced error shows it working as expected

Improved logging from Accept controller (because details aren't logged elsewhere).

Now I can switch event bus types with an env variable and both options work.

**COMMIT: FIX: run time failures with new event bus model; everything works now**
