* Does the use case need to know about API versions? 
  * Can I remove API version from DTOs and let controllers decide to accept/reject based on API version?
  * Controller would need to deal with any API version differences that might cause issues.

Next major steps
* Write controllers - let's go with express for now
* Add a proper logger - let's go with pino for now
* Add persistence - use TypeORM with sqlite for now
