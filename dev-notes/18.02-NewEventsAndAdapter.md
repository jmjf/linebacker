# Build new events and KafkaJS adapter and message handler for first event

## Events

Events have getters for `messageKey()`, `messageData()` and `topicName()`. The constructor accepts an object and builds a message-ready form of it.

I'll build two events

-  `BackupRequestAccepted` (enqueue)
-  `BackupRequestReceived` (in database)

`BackupRequestAccepted` takes the base backup request from the enqueue use case. It should have the data from the response body.

```typescript
const responseBody = {
	backupRequestId: result.value.id.value,
	backupJobId: (backupJobId as UniqueIdentifier).value,
	dataDate: dt.toISOString().slice(0, 10), // only the date part
	preparedDataPathName: v.preparedDataPathName,
	statusTypeCode: v.statusTypeCode,
	receivedTimestamp: v.receivedTimestamp,
	requesterId: v.requesterId,
};
```

`BackupRequestReceived` only holds a `BackupRequestId`.

## Message handler for BackupRequestAccepted

The message handler will get a message that looks like the response body. It needs to call a new use case (`ReceiveBackupRequestUseCase`) that looks a lot like `CreateBackupRequestUseCase`. The message handler is like the subscriber `on...` method, so is responsible for any error handling and logging. It returns a value that indicates whether the message processed successfully, should be retried (dependency error), or is unprocessable.

```typescript
export const MessageHandlerResponseTypes = {
	Retry: 'retry',
	Reject: 'reject',
	Commit: 'commit',
} as const;
// as const prevents changing or adding values;

export type MessageHandlerResponseType = typeof MessageHandlerResponseTypes[keyof typeof MessageHandlerResponseTypes];

export const validMessageHandlerResponseTypes = Object.values(MessageHandlerResponseTypes);
```

## KafkaJS adapter

The adapter constructor takes client configuration data (figure out what after setup). It sets up a client, producer, and maybe a retry producer and connects the producer(s).

The `publish` method uses the producer to publish the event to the topic. It calls methods on the event to get data for the message and calls `producer.send()`.

The `subscribe` method creates a consumer (requires a consumer group) and subscribes it to the topic. It runs the message handler, with a default wrapper that, based on the results of the message handler, commits, reproduces for retry or logs a bad message. In the future, it may take a bad message handler that's responsible for doing whatever needs to be done with bad messages

## Notes

-  I'll prefix all the event names with "K" to avoid collisions until I get through all the changes
-  I created `common/event` and wrote `EventBus.ts`
   -  `IBusEvent` is the interface events implement; added a few methods
   -  `BusEventHandlerResult`, `BusEventHandlerResultType`, and `busEventHandlerResultTypeValues` are about the values a handler can return
   -  Rest may or may not go further depending on details of implementation TBD
-  Wrote `KBackupRequestAccepted` message
   -  Messages are carry data as an object and have object and string getters (are responsible for knowing how to serialize themselves)
-  Created `common/messaging` (not sure that's where this will live) and wrote `/KafkajsAdapter.ts` and `IMessageBusAdapter.ts`
   -  constructor
      -  Accepts KafkaJS's `KafkaConfig`; only uses some values, sets retry count to 100
      -  Creates client
      -  Creates producer; adds event listeners to track connection state; starts connect
   -  publish
      -  if producer isn't connected, try to connect; err if can't connect
      -  try to publish message; use a semi-smart serializer
      -  catch -> log and return err
      -  Need better errors for both possible err cases
   -  \_connectProducer
      -  tries to connect producer; logs on failure; returns boolean
-  Moved `EnqueueBackupRequestUseCase` to `AcceptBackupRequestUseCase` and adjusted
-  Copied `CreateBackupRequestuseCase` to `ReceiveBackupRequestUseCase` and adjusted
-  Wrote `KBackupRequestAcceptedMessageHandler.ts` (in `modules/backup-request/adapters`);
-  Wrote `KBackupRequestReceived` message

I want to put together a basic test of the parts

-  Test 1
   -  Write a consumer to read a topic and log messages (`consoleConsumer`)
   -  Write a producer using the adapter and the message to send a few messages (`1802-01Producer`)
   -  The producer is returning ok from the `publish` through the adapter
   -  Means the adapter is setting up the client and connecting okay
   -  The output from the consumer matches the message (data agrees; key makes sense)
   -  Except backupJobId is backupRequestId; wrong mapping in the message; fixed
-  Test 2
   -  Copy the message handler and give it a use case that `console.log`s arguments
   -  Change the consumer to use the console message handler
   -  Use `1802-01Producer` to produce events
   -  The message handler is logging to the console
   -  Means the message handler structure works as expected
   -  Also means the overall plan works as expected

These tests are basic tests, but they give confidence that the approach works and that continuing makes sense.

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: build starting components for Kafka-based messaging; confirm basics work (more testing to come)**

## NEXT

-  Define errors for message bus adapter
-  Figure out how to test with KafkaJS and fix tests
   -  May need to build a fake of some kind to deal with connect and other behavior
-  Ensure both new use cases are covered in tests and properly tested (red, green)
-  Add subscribe method to adapter
-  Ensure topics are created with partitions (new adapter method)
-  Determine how to detect connectivity errors in the message handler and respond

   -  Can I build in connectivity checks to avoid useless runs?

-  Write an integration test with jest that
   -  Sets up a components and spies on key methods
   -  Runs the accept use case
   -  Asserts
      -  publish is called the correct number of times
      -  message handler runs
      -  the receive use case runs
      -  save is called (mock database adapter save to return ok)
-  Run the console consumer on the second topic and see message
