# Receiving from the queue

## Notes

### Basic message handling loop

-  Try to receive a message from the queue
-  If received a message
   -  Call a message handler with message payload and await result
   -  If result is ok, delete the message from the queue

### Receive function

The poller to call the adapter's receive function (same poller may work for others). The read function will pass `useBase64` to the `AzureQueue.receiveMessage()` method and get back a decoded message body. If the poller reads many messages at once, call the handler for each message. (Handler handles one message at a time.)

```typescript
// something like
const { receivedMessageItems, ...restOfResponse } = responseResult;
const resultValue = { ...restOfResponse, receivedMessageItems: [] };
if (!useBase64) {
	resultValue.receivedMessageItems = receivedMessageItems;
} else if (receivedMessageItems.length > 0) {
	resultValue.receivedMessageItems = receivedMessageItems.map((item) => fromBase64(item));
}
```

### Message handler

The message handler will dispatch an event to process the message. Events need to be able to accept a data body that is more than an id. The event subscriber will get the data from the event and pass it to the use case. The event subscriber is responsible for calling the delete message function on the adapter. (Use case should not care about mechanics of the queue so it can work for different models.)

Ensure the event from the message handler includes only data the `IDomainEvent` needs

-  `receivedMessageItems` has both `messageId` and `popReceipt`
-  Do not need anything else from the `QueueReceiveMessageResponse` for the event handler
-  Should be automatic if I loop over `receivedMessageItems` and dispatch events for each
-  "event subscriber is responsible for calling the delete message function" means I need a delete function in `AzureQueue`

### Event implications

-  On `DomainEventBus`, `publishToSubscribers()` is private; needs to be public so the handler can call it
-  `publishToSubscribers()` sends the whole `IDomainEvent` object, so no changes needed there
-  `IDomainEvent` only supports id payloads (`getAggregateId(): UniqueIdentifier`); need a `getDataPayload(): unknown` method to return carried data

### Adapter considerations

Do I want to have a single adapter that handles send, receive, delete, and other operations (circuit breaker will need a way to detect connection working after it trips open)?

Or do I want separate adapters for separate functions?

If I assume each queue is a one-way channel (assumed in the system architecture), separate adapters makes it harder to do something stupid like sending and read/deleting the same queue. OTOH, hopefully no one is that stupid and I can warn against stupid in the documentation.

A single adapter makes it easier to use--just `new AzureQueueAdapter(queueName, useBase64)`. I could pass an "intent" and disallow functions that violate the intent (`if (intent !== 'send') return err()`).

-  send -> send
-  receive -> receive, delete
-  liveness check never checks intent because it doesn't change the queue, so is available for all intents

### AzureQueue env considerations

The `AzureQueue` class assumes that credential data it needs is in the env. Is this a good assumption?

-  For AAD app registration connections (ADCC), credential data must be in specific places in `process.env` for `DefaultAzureCredential`
   -  If I need different identities, I run a risk that two processes will change `process.env` and create conflicts for each other
   -  But should a single application need (or have) different identities (unlikely)
   -  I may be able to switch from `DefaultAzureCredential` to `ClientSecretCredential` or `ClientCertificateCredential`, which would let me pass values to their constructors instead of using env
   -  I think those alternatives will work because they have a `getToken()` method, which implies they're a type of `TokenCredential`, which the `QueueClient` constructor will accept
   -  Whether different identities are needed or now, it may be better to pass the values that inject them into `process.env` programmatically
      -  But if those values are updated from a credential vaulting service when auth fails, I'll need some way to set them globally
      -  Of course, in that case, I could use env names that are chosen specifically for that sharing purpose
   -  For now, I'm going to stick with `DefaultAzureCredential`, but this line of thinking is worth preserving for the future.

`AzureQueue` also assumes that the storage account URI is in env and that it uses a single storage account. Is this a good assumption?

-  It makes sense that all the queues would be in one account, but there might be use cases where that isn't true
-  I believe this is more likely to be a concern than credential switching
-  One solution might be to have an optional parameter for account URI in the `AzureQueue` entry methods; if provided use it; if not, get it from env
   -  This strategy might also be a good answer for credentials (pass credential data as a data structure (object) to make it easier)

## AzureQueue

-  receive function
-  delete function

## Queue adapter

-  receive function
-  delete function
-  One queue adapter with required "intent"

## Event and subscriber

-  Changes to `IDomainEvent` to support data and `DomainEventBus` to publish events outside of an aggregate save
-  Event subscriber for `receive-create-backup-reply` - `AzureBackupRequestStatusReceived`
   -  Because it's the "Azure" subscriber, it knows it needs the Azure adapter, queue name, etc.
      -  Can create in constructor or pass on create; event subscribers are akin to controllers (think about how that might affect code organization)
   -  Execute use case; get result
   -  Delete message
   -  Log result, including message delete result
-  Do I need to worry about failure recovery?
   -  IN ALL CASES, LOG DETAILS ABOUT REQUEST AND QUEUE ACTION (delete or not delete)
   -  If use case fails for missing/bad data on reply (invalid status, no request id, request doesn't exist, job doesn't exist), delete message
   -  If use case fails because request is already replied, delete message
      -  Write updated request after writing backup; if backup exists, skip writing backup; use case already does this
   -  If use case fails for technology reasons (couldn't write database, etc.), do not delete message (let it come back later)
      -  Need to distinguish between technology reasons and other reasons in error
   -  If use case returns a request that is succeeded or failed, delete the message

## Message handler

-  Set up event
-  Publish event
-  Define an interface the poller can rely on

## Queue poller

-  Needs to start when server comes up and run in a loop
-  If no messages on the queue, increment the polling interval to a maximum
-  If messages on the queue, reset polling interval
-  Queue poller is responsible for read and call message handler only -- no delete
-  Needs to be a class with parameters that let me use it for different queues
