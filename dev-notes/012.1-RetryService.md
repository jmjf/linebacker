# Build the retry service

Attributes

-  \_delayMs -- how long to wait between each retry
-  \_state -- allows stopping `runRetries`
-  \_retryEvents -- array of events to retry

Methods

-  get state -- returns \_state
-  set delayMs -- sets \_delayMs to a value passed
-  startRetries -- changes \_state to 'Started', allowing retries to run
-  stopRetries -- changes \_state to 'Halted', stopping any running retries
-  addRetry -- adds an event to the array if not already present (constructor names match and ids match)
-  runRetries -- loops through array and executes retries until array is empty or Halted
-  get retryEventIds -- returns an array of ids from the retry events
-  get retryEventCount -- returns the number of retries in the retry array

**COMMIT: FEAT: (incomplete) add RetryService; will test as part of circuit breaker**

## Rename

I decided to call this `DelayedEventRunner` instead of `RetryService`.

-  Better describes what it does
-  Doesn't limit the concept to retries--I can use it anywhere I want to run a set of events with a delay

Attributes

-  \_delayMs -- how long to wait between each event
-  \_state -- allows stopping `runEvents`
-  \_events -- array of events to run on delay
-  \_abortSignal -- passed in the constructor, allows stopping any delay for shutdown

Methods

-  isStateRun -- returns true if \_state is Run
-  isStateHalt -- returns true if \_state is Halt
-  setStateRun -- changes \_state to 'Run', allowing events to run (does not start running)
-  setStateHalt -- changes \_state to 'Halt', stopping any running event
-  addEvent -- adds an event \_events if not already present (constructor names match and ids match)
-  runEvents -- loops through \_events and executes events until \_events is empty or Halted
-  get eventIds -- returns an array of ids from \_events
-  get eventCount -- returns the number of events in \_events
-  set delayMs -- sets \_delayMs to a value passed

**COMMIT: REFACTOR: rename RetryService to DelayedEventRunner**
