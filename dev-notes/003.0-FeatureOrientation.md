# Feature orientation

## Change of approach

So far, I've been thinking about building whole entities and building to the outer layers from there. But this morning I decided I needed to change the approach a bit. I'm always telling folks to think about "vertical slice" stories that cut through all the layers of the system to deliver a feature. That may be as small as adding a single control to a web application, but including changes for the UI, use case, business logic, and data storage in that story. At the end, we've added one control, but that control works. The feature may need other controls before we can use the feature, but adding the control delivers part of the value of the feature and can be deployed. We can put it behind a feature flag that lets us expose it in testing but hide it in production if we don't want production users touching it yet.

So, let's think in terms of features.

We know of three major capabilities for the backup controller (BC):

-  Request a backup
-  Delete a backup
-  Restore a backup

I want to focus on the "request a backup" feature. What features does the it need:

-  When a requester sends a backup request, we must create it or respond with an error -> Use Case
   -  Get an HTTP request for the backup -> requester to infrastructure using Router using Controller
   -  Map request data transfer object (DTO) to domain -> Controller using Mapper
   -  Create the backup request domain object -> Controller using Use Case using Backup Request entity
   -  Store the backup request -> Use Case using Mapper and Repository; Repository using infrastructure
   -  Map the response to a DTO -> Use Case using Mapper
   -  Respond to requester -> Use Case to Controller to infrastructure to requester
-  Confirm a backup request is allowed
-  Send a backup request to the AZI
-  Receive backup request status from the AZI
-  Store data about known backups

I see the request flow through the architecture layers looking something like the diagram below. If it seems intimidating consider these points.

-  I don't own the Outside World.
-  My only action for the Infrastructure layer is choosing which frameworks, databases, etc., to use. I own no code in this layer.
-  The Adapter layer is simple glue code and follows common patterns for a specific type (Router, Controller, etc.).
-  Code and tests are focused on the Application and Domain layers--the business process, data, and logic.
-  I can inject do-nothing substitutes for the adapters or infrastructure to test the code I write.
-  If I add new infrastructure components (a queue service, for example) or use different infrastructure components (a different data store), I can add new adapters or change existing adapters and add or replace infrastructure components. My core application code rarely needs to change.

## Organization considerations

I want to organize code in terms of modules for specific entities or aggregates, but I also want to make the architecture boundaries explicit.

So, here's my basic project structure now:

```
linebacker/
    src/
        common/            (was ddd - base objects used by features)
            adapter/
            application/
            domain/
            infrastructure/ (may not be needed)
        backup-list/      (code supporting the list of all known backups -- not sure about this name or division)
            adapter/
            application/
            domain/
            infrastructure/ (may not be needed)
        create-backup/    (code supporting the create backup feature)
            ...
        delete-backup/    (code supporting the delete backup feature)
            ...
        restore-backup/   (code supporting the restore backup feature)
            ...
```

I know create, delete, and restore will need parts of the backup list to add, find, and delete backup data. I'll need an good way to do this. Maybe it's just calling the repository from the use case. Maybe I want an event bus or something similar. I also know backup list will need an HTTP interface so the UI can call it to get a list of backups to display and to report changes that may affect delete dates, so that will involve the repository too.

Sorting that out can wait. The backup list is involved at the end of the create backup use case, so I have time to think about it as I figure out other parts of the code. A lot of it probably comes down to the complexity of writing an entry to the backup list.

Last minute thought before I wrap up. Create, delete, and restore backup are more about managing the requests for those actions. The backup list only matters at the start or end (or both) of each feature. (Restore may manage a restored backup list and delete may care about restored backups so it can ensure they're deleted too.) This division may end up not making sense, but for now, I'm going with it. If I decide there's a better solution, I'll adjust. (I expect I'll find that before I get too far down the path.)

## Next steps

-  3.1.1 - Get the request backup use case working (use case, domain entity)
   -  Include unit tests for everything
   -  The use case needs a repository, so write a stub repository to always return ok for now
-  3.1.2 - Get the backup request controller and mapper working
   -  Mapper unit tests confirm it maps data to/from as expected
   -  Controller unit tests run the use case
-  3.1.3 - Create the router and add a route, call it with Insomnia and get a result
-  3.1.4 - Pick a database of some kind and write the repository to connect to it
   -  Unit tests mock the database interface
-  Figure out the next step (3.2.1)
   -  Probably confirming the request is allowed, which requires a mock UI-owned service to get the backup job

**COMMIT: 3.0.0 - reorganize around features**
