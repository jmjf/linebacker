# Add `FastifyBackupRequestController`

## Plan
* 6.1.1 - `FastifyCreateBackupRequestController` (rename).
   * 2 - Figure out how to test for `InvalidApiVersionError`.
   * 3-n - Add tests for other test conditions
      * Invalid properties get `PropsError` (how many props to test?)
      * Other use case failures get ServerError and the enclosed error is the proper type.
      * If all is good, get the expected reply value
   * n+1 - Can (should) I replace some or all use case tests with controller tests?

**COMMIT 6.1.1 - REFACTOR: Rename `CreateBackupRequestFastifyController` to align with infra-first naming pattern used for Prisma repos**
