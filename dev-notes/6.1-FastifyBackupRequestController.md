# Add `FastifyBackupRequestController`

## Plan
* 6.1.1 - `FastifyCreateBackupRequestController` (rename).
   * Figure out how to test for `InvalidApiVersionError`.
   * Add tests for other test conditions
      * Invalid properties get `PropsError` (how many props to test?)
      * Other use case failures get ServerError and the enclosed error is the proper type.
      * If all is good, get the expected reply value
   * Can (should) I replace some or all use case tests with controller tests?

**COMMIT 6.1.1 - REFACTOR: Rename `CreateBackupRequestFastifyController` to align with infra-first naming pattern used for Prisma repos**

## Use Prisma repo in test
* Add Prisma imports
* Remove `IBackupRequestRepo` import
* Add `let` and `beforeEach()` setup
* Create repo, use case, controller

Doesn't fail tests, but isn't testing anything yet. But getting the test working needs several steps.

**COMMIT 6.1.2 - TEST: Set up controller test to use Prisma repo**

## Set up routes
* Check 4.x notes for discussion of how to set up routes
