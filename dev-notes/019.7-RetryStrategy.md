# Build a custom retry strategy for events that fail

## Problem

BullMQ's default retry strategies assume a small number of retries before giving up on the event or moving it to a poison queue (event abandonment). I want to use BullMQ's retry mechanism as part of my resilience model so I can replace `DelayedEventRunner` and remove retry responsibilty from `CircuitBreakerWithRetry`. (I can't get rid of either as long as I support the memory event bus, but want to be in position to remove them in the future.)

The consumer subtracts connect failures from attempts/retries when deciding to abandon an event, so it's ready.

The BullMQ configuration settings need to:

-  Set event retries to a large number by default
-  Set a custom backoff function (controls how long the job waits before retrying)

Question: If a job is returned for retry, is it blocking the rest of the queue? (I think not, but need to find a way to test.)

## What to do

-  In `BullmqEventBus`, `publishEvent`, set `attempts` (max number of retries) to a large number
-  Also set `backoff` to custom
-  Add `backoffStrategy` to `bmqWorker` (not the consumer)
-  Set `removeOnComplete` and `removeOnFail` based on env values

[Reference](https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/retrying-failing-jobs)

## Backoff function

I want:

-  to increase backoff time in steps until it reaches a maximum delay
-  to get the starting delay and maximum delay from env

The backoff function receives up to four parameters shown [here](https://api.docs.bullmq.io/types/BackoffStrategy.html).

Exponential growth -> initialValue \* (1 + rate)^x

-  initialValue = BMQ_RETRY_DELAY_START_MS
-  rate = 2
-  x = attemptsMade

So, the basic formula will be `Math.min(BRDS * (3^attemptsMade), BRDM)`

### Changes

-  Add `BMQ_RETRY_DELAY_START_MS` and `BMQ_RETRY_DELAY_MAX_MS` to `dev.env`
-  Add `backoffStrategy` to `bmqWorker`

## Event bus setup

Removal options can be undefined, true (removes immediately), a number (events to keep), or an object (events to keep, age to keep).

-  Set `attempts` to `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` - 1
-  Add `BMQ_REMOVE_ON_COMPLETE` and `BMQ_REMOVE_ON_FAIL` to `dev.env`
-  In `BullmqEventBus`, decide which option to treat as based on type (string or not) and value
-  Pass the computed removal options when publishing

## Testing

Unit tests pass, which isn't surprising because BullMQ is mocked in all unit tests and these changes affect untested (`bmqWorker`) or configuration only (`BullmqEventBus`) code.

The goal of testing is to see:

-  The custom backoff strategy runs
-  The event retries many times
-  The backoff delay reaches the maximum and doesn't exceed it
-  Confirm the backoff increment makes sense

I've added logging to the backoff function. I should be able to post a request with Azurite down and see it fail (because no Azure queue) and see behavior above.

-  It retries, but the delay decreases, then jumps up
-  Changed the log message to provide more detail
-  Exponent is `**` not `^`
-  Math results make sense now
-  Possible issue is that part of the calculation will give a value that exceeds MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
   -  By math, that should be around 34 retries
   -  I set the data in Redis to 33 attempts and watched it go well over MSI without failure
   -  Set Redis to 10000 attempts, the math value is null, but it's picking the limit value, so I think we're good
   -  Retry config will allow over 200 million years of retries, assuming a max of 1 second, so any breaks are likely to be fixed before we run out of retries
   -  Set Redis to MSI - 2 attempts; still getting the max delay (calc is null)
   -  The retries are running past MSI, but I think that makes sense, sort of, because these are connect failures
-  Start Azurite -- and the event finishes

Next test

-  Stop Azurite
-  Post a request
-  Wait for delay to reach max (60 sec)
-  Post another request
-  Events for the second request run even though the first request is still waiting
-  I can see the two events running out of sync with each other (based on attempts made in logging), which is what we want
-  Run Azurite and events run

Improve logging and retest

-  Stop Azurite; post a request; check log output
-  Example below

```
[00:58:20.086] INFO (linebacker/7283): Backoff delay
    service: "accepted-consumer"
    feature: "store"
    eventType: "BackupRequestAllowed"
    jobName: "-B1C4jTsjJ8SgqH_oocO1"
    attemptsMade: 3
    delayMs: 27000

```

Change log level to trace.

Testing the math in the browser, it looks like we get floating point values (3\*\*99 = 1.7179250691067044e+50, which is well over MSI) or `Infinity` when it exceeds the maximum number; `Math.min()` seems to handle `Infinity` sanely. Makes sense because the type is really number, not integer.

I'm curious why BullMQ doesn't kill the event when it exceeds MSI retries, but given that, even with 1 second max delay, we're looking at >200 million years, I'm not going to worry about it. Even if someone is crazy and sets the max delay to 1 millisecond, we have millenia of retry time.

Improved the code that gets delay values from env to handle errors better and ensure the minimum for each is 1 ms.

**COMMIT: FEAT: add custom retry backoff strategy that accepts a starting delay and a max delay from env in BullMq worker; allow customizing event removal from env**
