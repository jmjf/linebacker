# Authorization (the hard way)

## What's it about

For reasons, I'm keeping client scope data in the database instead of relying on the authN provider to give me scopes. I'll cache authZ data using mnemonist's LRU and add my own lazy TTL.

-  Middleware config
   -  cache size
   -  cache ttl (milliseconds)
   -  function to get authZ data for a client id from the database
   -  function to log errors
-  Code outline
   -  get client id from request (provided by authN) -> req.jwtPayload.sub
   -  get client id from cache (authZResult)
   -  if client id found and cached value ttl < now (expired), delete from cache, authZResult = undefined
   -  if authZResult undefined, read db -> dbAuthZResult, authZResult = { ttl, split dbAuthZResult.scopes on | }, cache authZResult
   -  if authZResult undefined, return error failed authZ (403)
   -  add authZResult.scopes to request

## Testing

-  Unit tests pass -- not surprising because unit tests use fake authNZ
-  Expired token fails as expected
-  Valid token gets 403 (jwtPayload undefined)
   -  Authzerizer is assigning `verifiedToken.payload` when it should assign `verifiedToken`
   -  TypeORM doesn't know about client authz data, need to add to entities
-  Authzeriezer seems to be working

Add a condition on the post request route to ensure the client has post-backup-request in scopes.

-  Typing this was a pain
-  Express route handlers can't accept my custom request, so I had to cast to use
-  Many solutions that either didn't work or were clunky, so I ended up casting in the route handler

Other

-  Changed the controller to pass `requesterId` to use case (`request.jwtPayload.sub || ''`)
-  Changed the use case to pass `requesterId` from the DTO to `create()`

**COMMIT: FEAT: add authorization middleware; apply to route**
